However, atmospheric turbulence leads to large, dynamic phase errors between participating apertures that limit fringe visibility using telescopes arrays or subaperture configurations in a single large telescope. Diffraction limited optics or adaptive optics can be used to ensure coherence at each aperture, but correlating the phase between apertures requires high speed, high stroke phase correction and recombination that is extremely challenging and costly. As a solution, we show an alternative phase correction and beam combination method using a centimeter-scale silicon astrophotonic chip optimized for H-band operation. The 4.7x10mm silicon photonic chip is fabricated using electron beam lithography with devices with 2 up to 32 independent channels. Light is coupled into the chip using single mode fiber ribbons. An array of microheaters is used to individually tune the effective index of each spiral delay waveguides. Narrowband spectral splitters at each spatial channel divert a modulated digital reference signal from an artificial guide star off-chip for phase measurement. Science light from other wavelengths is coherently combined using on-chip beam combiners and outputted to a single waveguide. We described the role, design, fabrication and characterization of the photonic chip. This photonic phase control scheme can be applied in astronomical interferometry or optical satellite communications.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06461'>Read More</a><h2>ESCAPE: Efficient Synthesis of Calibrations for Adaptive optics through Pseudo-synthetic and Empirical methods</h1><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the commissioning of the refurbished adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) for the 6.5-meter MMT Observatory under way, special consideration had to be made to properly calibrate the mirror response functions to generate an interaction matrix (IM). The commissioning of the ASM is part of the MMT Adaptive optics exoPlanet characterization System (MAPS) upgrade the observatory's legacy adaptive optics (AO) system. Unlike most AO systems, MAPS employs a convex ASM which prevents the introduction of a calibration source capable of simultaneously illuminating its ASM and wavefront sensor (WFS). This makes calibration of the AO system a significant hurdle in commissioning. To address this, we have employed a hybrid calibration strategy we call the Efficient Synthesis of Calibrations for Adaptive Optics through Pseudo-synthetic and Empirical methods (ESCAPE). ESCAPE combines the DO-CRIME on-sky calibration method with the SPRINT method for computing pseudo-synthetic calibration matrices. To monitor quasi-static system change, the ESCAPE methodology rapidly and continuously generates pseudo-synthetic calibration matrices using continual empirical feedback in either open or closed-loop. In addition, by measuring the current IM in the background while in close-loop, we are also able to measure the optical gains for pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS) systems. In this paper, we will provide the mathematical foundation of the ESCAPE calibration strategy and on-sky results from its application in calibrating the MMT Observatory's ASM. Additionally, we will showcase the validation of our approach from our AO testbed and share preliminary on-sky results from MMT.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06974'>Read More</a><h2>Deepest limits on scattered light emission from the Epsilon Eridani inner debris disk with HST/STIS</h1><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Epsilon Eridani ($\epsilon$ Eri) is one of the first debris disk systems detected by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). However, the system has thus far eluded detection in scattered light with no components having been directly imaged. Its similarity to a relatively young Solar System combined with its proximity makes it an excellent candidate to further our understanding of planetary system evolution. We present a set of coronagraphic images taken using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) coronagraph on the Hubble space telescope at a small inner working angle to detect a predicted warm inner debris disk inside 1". We used three different post-processing approaches; Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Karhunen-Lo`eve Image Processing (KLIP), and Classical reference differential imaging (RDI), to best optimize reference star subtraction, and find that NMF performed the best overall while KLIP produced the absolute best contrast inside 1". We present limits on scattered light from warm dust, with constraints on surface brightness at 6 mJy/as$^2$ at our inner working angle of 0.6". We also place a constraint of 0.5 mJy/as$^2$ outside 1", which gives us an upper limit on the brightness for outer disks and substellar companions. Finally, we calculated an upper limit on the dust albedo at $\omega <$ 0.487.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06973'>Read More</a><h2>Femtosecond laser written low-loss multiscan waveguides in fused silica</h1><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We report low-loss multiscan waveguides fabricated in fused silica using femtosecond laser writing technology. The multiscan principle allows to tailor the writing regime to excel at key features of any integrated photonic platform: coupling losses and propagation losses. We optimized the writing parameters for different sizes of square-shaped waveguides and reached the mode overlap value with a standard single-mode optical fiber of above 98.8\% and demonstrated very low coupling losses of 0.2 dB/facet on average. Propagation losses in the fabricated waveguides amounted to 0.07 dB/cm. We applied the developed recipe to the fabrication of a fiber-coupled 25-channel interferometer with total insertion losses below 1 dB. The findings of this work are of interest for broad range of applications and in particular for optical information processing and quantum photonics.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06688'>Read More</a><h2>Si-waveguide-based optical power monitoring of 2$\times$2 Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interferometer based on InGaAsP/Si hybrid MOS optical phase shifter</h1><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transparent in-line optical power monitoring in Si programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is indispensable for calibrating integrated optical devices such as optical switches and resonators. A Si waveguide (WG) photodetector (PD) based on defect-mediated photodetection is a promising candidate for a transparent in-line optical power monitor owing to its simplicity and ease of integration with a fully complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible process. Here, we propose a simple optical power monitoring scheme for a 2$\times$2 Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interferometer (MZI) optical switch based on InGaAsP/Si hybrid MOS optical phase shifters. In the proposed scheme, a low-doped p-type Si WG PD with a response time of microseconds is utilized as a transparent in-line optical power monitor and the ground terminal of the MOS optical phase shifter is shared with that of the Si WG PD to enable the simple monitoring of the output optical power of the MZI. Based on this scheme, we experimentally demonstrate that the output optical power of a 2$\times$2 MZI can be simply monitored by applying a bias voltage to the Si slabs formed at the output WGs of the MZI without excess optical insertion loss.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06671'>Read More</a><h2>Open whispering gallery modes resonators</h1><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>There are some issues with traditional whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators like poor light extraction and a dense mode spectrum. In this paper we introduce a solution to these limitations by proposing open WGM (OWGM) resonators that effectively reduce the mode density and enable directional radiation through a connected waveguide at the expense of some lowering in Q-factor. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional metallic and dielectric disk resonators with holes reveal a significant increase in intermode distance. The study also extends to three-dimensional dielectric OWGM resonators, demonstrating the formation of sparse spectra suitable for photonics applications. Additionally, the design of a cylindrical Bragg microresonator connected to a single-mode fiber via an optimized topology-based connector achieves near-unity transmission and efficient coupling. This approach enhances the development of new photonic devices, addressing the limitations of traditional high Q-factor WGM resonators and offering potential advancements in laser technology and optical communications, where compactness and manufacturability are prioritized over ultra-high Q-factors.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06436'>Read More</a><h2>Coherence Awareness in Diffractive Neural Networks</h1><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffractive neural networks hold great promise for applications requiring intensive computational processing. Considerable attention has focused on diffractive networks for either spatially coherent or spatially incoherent illumination. Here we illustrate that, as opposed to imaging systems, in diffractive networks the degree of spatial coherence has a dramatic effect. In particular, we show that when the spatial coherence length on the object is comparable to the minimal feature size preserved by the optical system, neither the incoherent nor the coherent extremes serve as acceptable approximations. Importantly, this situation is inherent to many settings involving active illumination, including reflected light microscopy, autonomous vehicles and smartphones. Following this observation, we propose a general framework for training diffractive networks for any specified degree of spatial and temporal coherence, supporting all types of linear and nonlinear layers. Using our method, we numerically optimize networks for image classification, and thoroughly investigate their performance dependence on the illumination coherence properties. We further introduce the concept of coherence-blind networks, which have enhanced resilience to changes in illumination conditions. Our findings serve as a steppingstone toward adopting all-optical neural networks in real-world applications, leveraging nothing but natural light.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06681'>Read More</a><h2>The role of the inverse Cherenkov effect in the formation of ultrashort Raman solitons in silica microspheres</h1><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We theoretically demonstrate a new regime of the formation of ultrashort optical solitons in spherical silica microresonators with whispering gallery modes.The solitons are driven by a coherent CW pump at the frequency in the range of normal dispersion, and the energy is transferred from this pump to the solitons via two channels: Raman amplification and the inverse Cherenkov effect. We discuss three different regimes of soliton propagation and we also show that these Raman solitons can be controlled by weak coherent CW signals.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06802'>Read More</a><h2>Polarization entanglement enabled by orthogonally stacked van der Waals NbOCl2 crystals</h1><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Polarization entanglement holds significant importance for photonic quantum technologies. Recently emerging subwavelength nonlinear quantum light sources, e.g., GaP and LiNbO3 thin films, benefiting from the relaxed phase-matching constraints and volume confinement, has shown intriguing properties, such as high-dimensional hyperentanglement and robust entanglement anti-degradation. Van der Waals (vdW) NbOCl2 crystal, renowned for its superior optical nonlinearities, has emerged as one of ideal candidates for ultrathin quantum light sources [Nature 613, 53 (2023)]. However, polarization-entanglement is inaccessible in NbOCl2 crystal due to its unfavorable nonlinear susceptibility tensor. Here, by leveraging the twist-stacking degree of freedom inherently in vdW systems, we showcase the preparation of tunable polarization entanglement and quantum Bell states. Our work not only provides a new and tunable polarization-entangled vdW photon-pair source, but also introduces a new knob in engineering the entanglement state of quantum light at the nanoscale.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06751'>Read More</a></body></html>
