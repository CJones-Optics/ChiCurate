However, atmospheric turbulence leads to large, dynamic phase errors between participating apertures that limit fringe visibility using telescopes arrays or subaperture configurations in a single large telescope. Diffraction limited optics or adaptive optics can be used to ensure coherence at each aperture, but correlating the phase between apertures requires high speed, high stroke phase correction and recombination that is extremely challenging and costly. As a solution, we show an alternative phase correction and beam combination method using a centimeter-scale silicon astrophotonic chip optimized for H-band operation. The 4.7x10mm silicon photonic chip is fabricated using electron beam lithography with devices with 2 up to 32 independent channels. Light is coupled into the chip using single mode fiber ribbons. An array of microheaters is used to individually tune the effective index of each spiral delay waveguides. Narrowband spectral splitters at each spatial channel divert a modulated digital reference signal from an artificial guide star off-chip for phase measurement. Science light from other wavelengths is coherently combined using on-chip beam combiners and outputted to a single waveguide. We described the role, design, fabrication and characterization of the photonic chip. This photonic phase control scheme can be applied in astronomical interferometry or optical satellite communications."}

SEAL consists of several wavefront sensors (WFS) and deformable mirrors (DM) that are currently performing techniques like predictive control or non-linear reconstruction. In this paper, we present the implementation and characterization of a new coronagraphic branch on SEAL and assess the contrast limitations in the testbed. For our coronagraphic branch, we used a vector vortex coronagraph which has high contrast performance. The W. M. Keck Observatory also uses a vortex coronagraph, allowing us to compare the limitations with our own coronagraph. We relied on the testbed and simulations of the vortex coronagraph to compare performance with expected ones. To create a more reliable simulation, we also injected in our numerical model data collected by a Zernike Wavefront sensor (ZWFS) used to perform fine wavefront sensing on the bench. Now that the coronagraphic branch is aligned on SEAL, we will be able to use contrast as a metric for the performance of wavefront control methods on the bench."}

Working with Green Bank Telescope data from PSR J1730+0747 in the form of complex-valued channelized voltages and their respective high-resolution power spectral densities, we evaluate a variety of statistical measures to characterize RFI. As a baseline for performance comparison, we use median absolute deviation (MAD) in complex channelized voltage data and spectral kurtosis (SK) in power spectral density data to characterize and filter out RFI. From a new perspective, we implement the Shapiro-Wilks (SW) test for normality and two information theoretical measures, spectral entropy (SE) and spectral relative entropy (SRE), and apply them to mitigate RFI. The baseline RFI mitigation algorithms are compared against our novel RFI detection algorithms to determine how effective and robust the performance is. Except for MAD, we find significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio through the application of SE, symmetrical SRE, asymmetrical SRE, SK, and SW. These algorithms also do a good job of characterizing broadband RFI. Time- and frequency-variable RFI signals are best detected by SK and SW tests."}

Accurate identification of gravitational wave candidates and rapid release of sky localization information are crucial for the success of these electromagnetic follow-up observations. However, searches for gravitational wave candidates in real time suffer a non-negligible false alarm rate. By leveraging the sky localization information and other metadata associated with gravitational wave candidates, GWSkyNet, a machine learning classifier developed by Cabero et al.

We improve the performance of the classifier for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run by reviewing and updating the architecture and features used as inputs by the algorithm. We also retrain and fine-tune the classifier with data from the third observing run. To improve the prospect of electromagnetic follow-up observations, we incorporate GWSkyNet into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's low-latency infrastructure as an automatic pipeline for the evaluation of gravitational wave alerts in real time. We test the readiness of the algorithm on a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA mock data challenge campaign.

We aim to contribute to the ASTER mission by defining the parameters of a multispectral camera system that will be used to study the asteroid system 2001 SN263, through software simulations that should help planning the data collection. We inserted the shape model of the objects in the software POV-Ray and modeled two cameras, a Wide Angle (WAC) and a Narrow Angle (NAC). We inserted the asteroid's parameters and simulated the satellite position. We created various scenes so we could obtain a good view of the asteroid. Alpha is entirely visible only in the WAC images, while the NAC is expected to reveal surface details. Beta seems relatively small in the WAC images, whereas we obtain a broad view from the NAC at 100 km distance. Gamma, smaller than Beta, should provide more detailed images through the NAC, whereas the WAC images should be able to show its inclined orbit around Alpha. To see Gamma behind Alpha in its revolution movement, we would have to elevate the camera's orbit. The method employed to simulate images generated by satellite cameras can be applied to other scenarios where the target requires imaging, extending beyond the field of planetary geology."}

The commissioning of the ASM is part of the MMT Adaptive optics exoPlanet characterization System (MAPS) upgrade the observatory's legacy adaptive optics (AO) system. Unlike most AO systems, MAPS employs a convex ASM which prevents the introduction of a calibration source capable of simultaneously illuminating its ASM and wavefront sensor (WFS). This makes calibration of the AO system a significant hurdle in commissioning. To address this, we have employed a hybrid calibration strategy we call the Efficient Synthesis of Calibrations for Adaptive Optics through Pseudo-synthetic and Empirical methods (ESCAPE). ESCAPE combines the DO-CRIME on-sky calibration method with the SPRINT method for computing pseudo-synthetic calibration matrices. To monitor quasi-static system change, the ESCAPE methodology rapidly and continuously generates pseudo-synthetic calibration matrices using continual empirical feedback in either open or closed-loop. In addition, by measuring the current IM in the background while in close-loop, we are also able to measure the optical gains for pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS) systems. In this paper, we will provide the mathematical foundation of the ESCAPE calibration strategy and on-sky results from its application in calibrating the MMT Observatory's ASM. Additionally, we will showcase the validation of our approach from our AO testbed and share preliminary on-sky results from MMT."}

In this study, we investigate the capability of future X-ray observatories to detect more exoplanet transits, focusing on both the NewAthena-WFI instrument and the proposed Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), which provide more light-collecting power than current instruments. We examined all the transiting exoplanet systems in the NASA Exoplanet Archive and gathered X-ray flux measurements or estimates for each host star. We then predicted the stellar count rates for both AXIS and NewAthena and simulated light curves, using null-hypothesis testing to identify the top 15 transiting planets ranked by potential detection significance. We also evaluate transit detection probabilities when the apparent X-ray radius is enlarged due to atmospheric escape, finding that $\\geq 5$ of these planetary systems may be detectable on the $>4\\sigma$ level in this scenario.

In this paper, we adapt these design principles to build a DNN architecture for wide parameter-space searches in ten days of data from two detectors (H1 and L1). We train a DNN for each of the benchmark cases: six all-sky searches and eight directed searches at different frequencies in the search band of 20 - 1000 Hz. We compare our results to the DNN sensitivity achieved from arXiv:2005.04140[gr-qc] and find that our trained DNNs are more sensitive in all the cases.

An all-sky DNN trained on the entire search band of 20 - 1000 Hz shows a high sensitivity at all frequencies providing a proof of concept for training a single DNN to perform the entire search.

At such large event rates, the buffers of the SK analog-to-digital conversion board (QBEE) will overflow, causing random loss of data that is critical for understanding the dynamics of the supernova explosion mechanism. In order to solve this problem, two new DAQ modules were developed to aid in the observation of very nearby supernovae. The first of these, the SN module, is designed to save only the number of hit PMTs during a supernova burst and the second, the Veto module, prescales the high rate neutrino events to prevent the QBEE from overflowing based on information from the SN module. In the event of a very nearby supernova, these modules allow SK to reconstruct the time evolution of the neutrino event rate from beginning to end using both QBEE and SN module data. This paper presents the development and testing of these modules together with an analysis of supernova-like data generated with a flashing laser diode. We demonstrate that the Veto module successfully prevents DAQ overflows for Betelgeuse-like supernovae as well as the long-term stability of the new modules. During normal running the Veto module is found to issue DAQ vetos a few times per month resulting in a total dead time less than 1\\,ms, and does not influence ordinary operations.

Importantly, this situation is inherent to many settings involving active illumination, including reflected light microscopy, autonomous vehicles and smartphones. Following this observation, we propose a general framework for training diffractive networks for any specified degree of spatial and temporal coherence, supporting all types of linear and nonlinear layers.

Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize a diffractive collection element operating at $\\lambda=397$ nm predicted to offer a total 0.25\\% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode.

Here, we report on the experimental observation of anomalous classical-to-quantum transitions in open many-body optical systems. We demonstrate, for the first time, the lack of classical-to-quantum correspondence between a macroscopic optical system and its constituent quantum multiphoton subsystems. In contrast to common belief, we demonstrate that the coherence dynamics of many-body quantum subsystems with up to forty particles can indeed be opposite to that exhibited by the hosting macroscopic system. By employing complex-Gaussian statistics, we show that these effects are universal for open many-body systems. Consequently, our work can have important implications for other fields of physics ranging from condensed matter to nuclear physics."}

However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to an anthropic abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method."}

Present work explores the desired control of photocurrent generation in monolayer graphene on ultrafast timescale. The origin of photocurrent is attributed to the asymmetric residual electronic population in the conduction band after the end of the laser pulse, which also facilitates valley polarization. Present study offers a comprehensive analysis of the differences between these two observables, namely photocurrent and valley polarization. It is found that the corotating circularly polarized $\\omega-2\\omega$ laser pulses allow the generation of photocurrent but no valley polarization, whereas counterrotating circularly polarized $\\omega-2\\omega$ laser pulses yield significant valley polarization without any photocurrent in graphene. Different laser parameters, such as subcycle phase, wavelength, and intensity provide different knobs to control the generation of the photocurrent. In addition, threefold increase in the photocurrent's amplitude can be achieved by altering electronic properties of graphene via strain engineering.

However, most of these studies assumed the strict FIFO rule or a specific arrival process, thus ignoring the potential impact of overtaking and the variation of traffic flows, especially in multi-lane scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic approach to derive the stochastic queue length by constructing a conditional probability model of no-delay arrival time (NAT), i.e., the arrival time of vehicles without experiencing any delay, based on multi-section LPR data. First, the NAT conditions for all vehicles are established based on upstream and downstream vehicle departure times and sequences. To reduce the computational dimensionality and complexity, a DP-based algorithm is developed for vehicle group partitioning based on potential interactions between vehicles. Then, the conditional probability of NATs of each vehicle group is derived and an MCMC sampling method is employed for calculation. Subsequently, the stochastic queue profile and maximum queue length for each cycle can be derived based on the NATs of vehicles. Eventually, to leverage the LPR data sufficiently, we extend our approach to multi-lane scenarios, where the problem can be converted to a weighted general exact coverage problem and solved by a backtracking algorithm with heuristics. Empirical and simulation experiments have shown that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and robustness across various traffic conditions, including different V\/C ratios, matching rates, and FIFO violation rates. In addition, the performance of the proposed approach can be further improved by utilizing multi-lane LPR data."}

However, the length of input CSI and the number of feedback bits should be adjustable in different scenarios, which can not be efficiently achieved by the existing CSI feedback models. Therefore, an adaptive bidirectional long short-term memory network (ABLNet) for CSI feedback is first designed to process various input CSI lengths, where the number of feedback bits is in proportion to the CSI length. Then, to realize a more flexible feedback bit number, a feedback bit control unit (FBCU) module is proposed to control the output length of feedback bits. Based on which, a target feedback performance can be adaptively achieved by a designed bit number adjusting (BNA) algorithm. Furthermore, a novel separate training approach is devised to solve the model protection problem that the UE and gNB are from different manufacturers.

Recent advancements in deep learning models have revolutionized this field, remarkably through the application of state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and DETR (Detection Transformer) to the spectrogram images. This paper focuses on optimizing the preprocessing stage to enhance the performance of these computer vision models. Specifically, we investigated the generation of training spectrograms via the classical Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) approach, examining four classical STFT parameters: FFT size, window type, window length, and overlapping ratio. Our study aims to maximize the mean average precision (mAP) scores of YOLOv10 models in detecting and classifying various digital modulation signals within a congested spectrum environment. Firstly, our results reveal that additional zero padding in FFT does not enhance detection and classification accuracy and introduces unnecessary computational cost. Secondly, our results indicated that there exists an optimal window size that balances the trade-offs between and the time and frequency resolution, with performance losses of approximately 10% and 30% if the window size is four or eight times off from the optimal. Thirdly, regarding the choice of window functions, the Hamming window yields optimal performance, with non-optimal windows resulting in up to a 10% accuracy loss.

Such an operation is mathematically equivalent to taking the modulo of the input signal with respect to the interval. To overcome the noise sensitivity of higher-order difference-based methods, we explore the properties of the first-order difference of modulo samples, and develop two line spectral estimation algorithms based on first-order difference, which are robust against noise. Specifically, we show that, with a high probability, the first-order difference of the original samples is equivalent to that of the modulo samples. By utilizing this property, line spectral estimation is solved via a robust sparse signal recovery approach. The second algorithms is built on our finding that, with a sufficiently high sampling rate, the first-order difference of the original samples can be decomposed as a sum of the first-order difference of the modulo samples and a sequence whose elements are confined to be three possible values. This decomposition enables us to formulate the line spectral estimation problem as a mixed integer linear program that can be efficiently solved.

Traditional codecs can tackle this problem by performing rate-distortion optimization (RDO) to minimize the distance at the output of a feature extractor. However, neural network non-linearities can make the rate-distortion landscape irregular, leading to reconstructions with poor visual quality even for high bit rates. Moreover, RDO decisions are made block-wise, while the feature extractor requires the whole image to exploit global information. In this paper, we address these limitations in three steps. First, we apply Taylor's expansion to the feature extractor, recasting the metric as an input-dependent squared error involving the Jacobian matrix of the neural network. Second, we make a localization assumption to compute the metric block-wise. Finally, we use randomized dimensionality reduction techniques to approximate the Jacobian. The resulting expression is monotonic with the rate and can be evaluated in the transform domain. Simulations with AVC show that our approach provides bit-rate savings while preserving accuracy in downstream tasks with less complexity than using the feature distance directly."}

A notable example is the EEG-based diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, which features subtler abnormal neural dynamics typically observed in small-group settings. To advance this area, in this work, we introduce a transferable framework employing Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification (MACS) to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders based on EEG signals sourced from four centers with unreliable annotations. The MACS framework's effectiveness stems from these features: 1) The Augmentor generates various EEG-represented brain variants to enrich the data space; 2) The Switcher enhances the feature space for trusted samples and reduces overfitting on incorrectly labeled samples; 3) The Encoder uses the Riemannian manifold and Euclidean metrics to capture spatiotemporal variations and dynamic synchronization in EEG; 4) The Projector, equipped with dual heads, monitors consistency across multiple brain variants and ensures diagnostic accuracy; 5) The Stratifier adaptively stratifies learned samples by confidence levels throughout the training process; 6) Forward and backpropagation in MACS are constrained by confidence stratification to stabilize the learning system amid unreliable annotations. Our subject-independent experiments, conducted on both neurocognitive and movement disorders using cross-center corpora, have demonstrated superior performance compared to existing related algorithms. This work not only improves EEG-based diagnostics for cross-center and small-setting brain diseases but also offers insights into extending MACS techniques to other data analyses, tackling data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability in multimedia and multimodal content understanding."}

Using our synthetic RF datasets, we explored three different scenarios with congested communication and radar signals. In the first study, we applied YOLOv8 to detect and classify multiple digital modulation signals coexisting within a highly congested and dynamic spectral environment with significant overlap in both frequency and time domains. The trained model was able to achieve an impressive mean average precision (mAP) of 0.888 at an IoU threshold of 50%, signifying its robustness against spectral congestion. The second part of our research focuses on the detection and classification of multiple polyphase pulse radar signals, including Frank code and P1 through P4 codes. We were able to successfully train YOLOv8 to deliver a nearly perfect mAP50 score of 0.995 in a densely populated signal environment, further showcasing its capability in radar signal processing. In the last scenario, we demonstrated that the model can also be applied to the multi-target detection problem for continuous-wave radar. The synthetic datasets used in these experiments reflect a realistic mix of communication and radar signals with varying degrees of interference and congestion - a setup that has been overlooked by many past research efforts, which have primarily focused on ML-based classification of digital communication signal modulation schemes. Our study demonstrated the potential of advanced CV models in addressing spectrum sensing challenges in congested and dynamic RF environments involving both communication and radar signals. We hope our findings will spur further collaborative efforts to tackle the complexities of congested RF spectrum environments."}

Unlike existing algorithms, JTSCE employs a maximum length sequence (MLS) rather than an isolated signal as the pilot. Distinctively, JTSCE explores MLS's autocorrelation properties to estimate timing offset and channel delay taps. After obtaining delay taps, closed-form expressions of Doppler and channel gain for each propagation path are derived. Simulation results indicate that, compared to its counterpart, JTSCE achieves better bit error rate performance, close to that with perfect time synchronization and channel state information."}

The nature of emotions is a physiological and psychological state change in response to brain region connectivity, making emotion recognition focus more on the dependency between brain regions instead of specific brain regions. A significant trend is the application of graphs to encapsulate such dependency as dynamic functional connections between nodes across temporal and spatial dimensions. Concurrently, the neuroscientific underpinnings behind this dependency endow the application of graphs in this field with a distinctive significance. However, there is neither a comprehensive review nor a tutorial for constructing emotion-relevant graphs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of graph-related methods in this field from a methodological perspective. We propose a unified framework for graph applications in this field and categorize these methods on this basis. Finally, based on previous studies, we also present several open challenges and future directions in this field."}

We establish a sandwich relation on the spectrum of Riemannian and Euclidean Hessians at first-order stationary points (FOSPs). As a result of that, we obtain an equivalence on the set of FOSPs, second-order stationary points (SOSPs) and strict saddles between the manifold and the factorization formulations. In addition, we show the sandwich relation can be used to transfer more quantitative geometric properties from one formulation to another. Similarities and differences in the landscape connection under the PSD case and the general case are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first geometric landscape connection between the manifold and the factorization formulations for handling rank constraints, and it provides a geometric explanation for the similar empirical performance of factorization and manifold approaches in low-rank matrix optimization observed in the literature. In the general low-rank matrix optimization, the landscape connection of two factorization formulations (unregularized and regularized ones) is also provided. By applying these geometric landscape connections, in particular, the sandwich relation, we are able to solve unanswered questions in literature and establish stronger results in the applications on geometric analysis of phase retrieval, well-conditioned low-rank matrix optimization, and the role of regularization in factorization arising from machine learning and signal processing."}

Accurate source localization enables the elimination of the rotor core in atrial fibrillation (AFib) as an effective treatment for such severe cardiac disorder; it also finds potential use in locating the spreading source in natural disasters such as forest fires and tsunamis. However, existing approaches such as time of arrival (TOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) do not yield accurate localization results since they tacitly assume a constant signal propagation speed whereas realistic propagation is often non-static and heterogeneous. In this paper, we develop a nonlinear TDOA (NTDOA) approach which utilizes observational data from various positions to jointly learn the propagation speed at different angles and distances as well as the location of the source itself. Through examples of simulating the complex dynamics of electrical signals along the surface of the heart and satellite imagery from forest fires and tsunamis, we show that with a small handful of measurements, NTDOA, as a data-driven approach, can successfully locate the spreading source, leading also to better forecasting of the speed and direction of subsequent propagation."}

However, unique channel features such as the near-field beam split effect make channel estimation particularly challenging in THz massive MIMO systems. On one hand, adopting the conventional angular domain transformation dictionary designed for low-frequency far-field channels will result in degraded channel sparsity and destroyed sparsity structure in the transformed domain. On the other hand, most existing compressive sensing-based channel estimation algorithms cannot achieve high performance and low complexity simultaneously. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we first adopt frequency-dependent near-field dictionaries to maintain good channel sparsity and sparsity structure in the transformed domain under the near-field beam split effect. Then, a deep unfolding-based wideband THz massive MIMO channel estimation algorithm is proposed. In each iteration of the unitary approximate message passing-sparse Bayesian learning algorithm, the optimal update rule is learned by a deep neural network (DNN), whose structure is customized to effectively exploit the inherent channel patterns. Furthermore, a mixed training method based on novel designs of the DNN structure and the loss function is developed to effectively train data from different system configurations. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of performance, complexity, and robustness."}

However, the existing SemCom structure is limited by the lack of context-reasoning ability and background knowledge provisioning, which, therefore, motivates us to seek the potential of incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies with SemCom. Recognizing GAI's powerful capability in automating and creating valuable, diverse, and personalized multimodal content, this article first highlights the principal characteristics of the combination of GAI and SemCom along with their pertinent benefits and challenges. To tackle these challenges, we further propose a novel GAI-integrated SemCom network (GAI-SCN) framework in a cloud-edge-mobile design. Specifically, by employing global and local GAI models, our GAI-SCN enables multimodal semantic content provisioning, semantic-level joint-source-channel coding, and AIGC acquisition to maximize the efficiency and reliability of semantic reasoning and resource utilization. Afterward, we present a detailed implementation workflow of GAI-SCN, followed by corresponding initial simulations for performance evaluation in comparison with two benchmarks. Finally, we discuss several open issues and offer feasible solutions to unlock the full potential of GAI-SCN."}

However, it also presents high path loss, resulting in limited coverage. High-gain beamforming from the antenna array is essential to mitigate the coverage limitations. The conventional phased antenna arrays (PAA) cause high scheduling latency owing to analog beam constraints, i.e., only one frequency-flat beam is generated. Recently introduced joint phase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true-time-delay (TTD) units and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam constraints by creating multiple frequency-dependent beams for scheduling multiple users at different directions in a frequency-division manner. One class of previous studies offered solutions with ``rainbow\" beams, which tend to allocate a small bandwidth per beam direction. Another class focused on uniform linear array (ULA) antenna architecture, whose frequency-dependent beams were designed along a single axis of either azimuth or elevation direction. This paper presents a novel 3D beamforming design that maximizes beamforming gain toward desired azimuth and elevation directions and across sub-bands partitioned according to scheduled users' bandwidth requirements. We provide analytical solutions and iterative algorithms to design the PSs and TTD units for a desired subband beam pattern. Through simulations of the beamforming gain, we observe that our proposed solutions outperform the state-of-the-art solutions reported elsewhere."}
{"id":"oai:arXiv.org:2402.00820v2","title":"USDnet: Unsupervised Speech Dereverberation via Neural Forward Filtering","abstract":"In reverberant conditions with a single speaker, each far-field microphone records a reverberant version of the same speaker signal at a different location. In over-determined conditions, where there are multiple microphones but only one speaker, each recorded mixture signal can be leveraged as a constraint to narrow down the solutions to target anechoic speech and thereby reduce reverberation. Equipped with this insight, we propose USDnet, a novel deep neural network (DNN) approach for unsupervised speech dereverberation (USD). At each training step, we first feed an input mixture to USDnet to produce an estimate for target speech, and then linearly filter the DNN estimate to approximate the multi-microphone mixture so that the constraint can be satisfied at each microphone, thereby regularizing the DNN estimate to approximate target anechoic speech. The linear filter can be estimated based on the mixture and DNN estimate via neural forward filtering algorithms such as forward convolutive prediction. We show that this novel methodology can promote unsupervised dereverberation of single-source reverberant speech."}

In this work, we employ this framework to the analysis of clinical heart time-series data, to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, termed PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We place a special emphasis on making both such pre-trained models fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that, in order to make predictions, the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, we show that tokens with the same value, which occur at different distinct points in the electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space. The clusters form according to phase, as the tokens propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models are straightforward to fine-tune for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation (AF), and beat detection in photoplethysmography. For the example of AF, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved the respective leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG within the MIMIC Perform AF dataset. In addition, the fine-tuned beat detector achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98%, as well as uniquely providing a beat confidence level which acts as a signal quality estimator. Importantly, the fine-tuned models for AF screening are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation."}
