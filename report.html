Experimental demonstration of photonic phase correctors based on grating coupler arrays and thermo-optic shifters</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In ground-based astronomy, the ability to couple light into single-mode fibers (SMFs) is limited by atmospheric turbulence, which prohibits the use of many astrophotonic instruments. We propose a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip capable of coherently coupling the out-of-phase beamlets from the subapertures of a telescope pupil into an SMF. The photonic integrated circuit (PIC) consists of an array of grating couplers that are used to inject light from free space into single-mode waveguides on the chip. Metallic heaters modulate the refractive index of a coiled section of the waveguides, facilitating the co-phasing of the propagating modes. The phased beamlets can then be coherently combined to efficiently deliver the light to an output SMF. In an adaptive optics (AO) system, the phase corrector acts as a deformable mirror (DM) commanded by a controller that takes phase measurements from a wavefront sensor (WFS). We present experimental results for the PIC tested on an AO testbed and compare the performance to simulations.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07735' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07735' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 90.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.9</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article demonstrates photonic phase correctors, which is relevant to FSOC and adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>2. Accelerating High-Fidelity Waveform Generation via Adversarial Flow Matching Optimization</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces PeriodWave-Turbo, a high-fidelity and high-efficient waveform generation model via adversarial flow matching optimization. Recently, conditional flow matching (CFM) generative models have been successfully adopted for waveform generation tasks, leveraging a single vector field estimation objective for training. Although these models can generate high-fidelity waveform signals, they require significantly more ODE steps compared to GAN-based models, which only need a single generation step. Additionally, the generated samples often lack high-frequency information due to noisy vector field estimation, which fails to ensure high-frequency reproduction. To address this limitation, we enhance pre-trained CFM-based generative models by incorporating a fixed-step generator modification. We utilized reconstruction losses and adversarial feedback to accelerate high-fidelity waveform generation. Through adversarial flow matching optimization, it only requires 1,000 steps of fine-tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various objective metrics. Moreover, we significantly reduce inference speed from 16 steps to 2 or 4 steps. Additionally, by scaling up the backbone of PeriodWave from 29M to 70M parameters for improved generalization, PeriodWave-Turbo achieves unprecedented performance, with a perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score of 4.454 on the LibriTTS dataset.

Amplified Light Beam Cooling via Emergent Onsager's Irreversible Thermodynamics</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>High-brightness coherent light source is at the heart of optical technology and yet challenging to achieve. Here, we propose an unconventional approach that utilizes the "forbidden chemical" in optical thermodynamics to convert any incoming light beam into a high-brightness, high-spatial-coherence light beam in multimode nonlinear optical waveguide systems, in contrast to evaporative cooling in cold atoms where the brightness is instead reduced. This approach is powered by the fact that light in nonlinear multimode structures undergoes an irreversible thermalization process triggered by its own photon-photon interactions. Moreover, the key characteristics in statistical mechanics, the optical temperature and chemical potential can be widely tuned in photonic systems. As such, when the chemical potential of an optical reservoir is designed to locate at the forbidden band of the probe bosonic system, it can never reach thermal equilibrium with the probe hence endlessly pumping the probe system towards an enhanced brightness and spatial coherence. This amplified cooling of light beam is revealed via both Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics theory and numerical simulations. Akin to this effect, the inverse photonic transport currents emerge due to the negative off-diagonal Onsager coefficients. We demonstrate the feasibility of the amplified beam cooling using a coupled multimode optical waveguide system and show that after 800 rounds of amplified cooling, the optical power of an incoming beam is enhanced by 16 times, meanwhile the fundamental mode occupancy is increased to 90%. These findings unveil an anomalous optical phenomenon and a new route toward high-quality light sources.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08204' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08204' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 60.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.6</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper is about cooling of light beams, which might indirectly relate to laser communication systems but does not explicitly discuss adaptive optics or atmospheric turbulence.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>4. Optimal Joint Fronthaul Compression and Beamforming Design for Networked ISAC Systems</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study investigates a networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where multiple base stations (BSs), connected to a central processor (CP) via capacity-limited fronthaul links, cooperatively serve communication users while simultaneously sensing a target. The primary objective is to minimize the total transmit power while meeting the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for communication and sensing under fronthaul capacity constraints, resulting in a joint fronthaul compression and beamforming design (J-FCBD) problem. We demonstrate that the optimal fronthaul compression variables can be determined in closed form alongside the beamformers, a novel finding in this field. Leveraging this insight, we show that the remaining beamforming design problem can be solved globally using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, albeit with considerable complexity. Furthermore, the tightness of its SDR reveals zero duality gap between the considered problem and its Lagrangian dual. Building on this duality result, we exploit the novel UL-DL duality within the ISAC framework to develop an efficient primal-dual (PD)-based algorithm. The algorithm alternates between solving beamforming with a fixed dual variable via fixed-point iteration and updating dual variable via bisection, ensuring global optimality and achieving high efficiency due to the computationally inexpensive iterations. Numerical results confirm the global optimality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed PD-based algorithm.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08057' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08057' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 60.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.6</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this paper discusses beamforming design, it focuses on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, not specifically FSOC or the other interests mentioned.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>5. A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, promises a revolutionary leap beyond traditional data-centric services. It aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then explores the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks. By embracing ISCC, we can unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08074' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08074' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 60.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.6</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Relevant due to its survey on integrated sensing and communication, which is related to FSOC systems.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>6. Picosecond laser pulses for quantum dot-microcavity based single photon generation by cascaded electro-optic modulation of a narrow-linewidth laser</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent developments in integrated optics have made it possible to fabricate high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators (EOMs). Here we show cascaded operation of two of such modulators driven by custom-built electronics delivering on-demand picosecond pulses and application to a quantum dot cavity-QED single photon source. We implement an EOM-based correlation technique and demonstrate light pulses as short as 24$\pm$2 ps with a single EOM. The EOMs can be synchronized and operated in series, we then produce optical pulses down to 17 ps. To optimize the pulse contrast, we analyze for two different EOM devices the transmission as a function of EOM bias, wavelength and temperature, and we show that by temperature tuning and stabilization, a pulse contrast above 25 dB can be obtained at the targeted wavelength. With this high contrast we demonstrate resonant excitation of an InGaAs quantum dot - microcavity based single photon source, demonstrating a crucial technology for scalability and synchronization of large scale photonic quantum applications.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08213' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08213' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 60.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.6</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper discusses single photon generation using cascaded electro-optic modulation, which could potentially relate to laser communication systems but does not directly cover adaptive optics or wavefront sensing.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>7. General theory of moving Fabry-Perot</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In a follow-up effort to our prior report on the optical transmission of a moving Fabry-Perot \cite{Pyvovar}, this work seeks to establish a general framework that describes the transmission and reflection properties of a Fabry-Perot interferometer when key components in its operation system, including the light source, the detector and the interferometer itself, have relative motions against each other along their common optical axis. Our analysis indicates that these movements result in various new factors in the transmission and reflection coefficients, which all find their roots in the Doppler effect. As a demonstration of its potential application, the new theory is applied to the Pound-Drever-Hall frequency-locking technique. It is shown that velocity-induced frequency modulations are effectively added to the laser frequency due to the motions, and such excess frequency noise can be impactful in certain applications.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08176' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08176' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 50.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.5</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this paper discusses Fabry-Perot cavities, it does not explicitly mention adaptive optics or optical communication systems.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>8. Fabrication and characterization of optical micro/nanofibers</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We experimentally demonstrate the fabrication of optical micro/nanofibers (MNFs) using chemical etching and gas-flame techniques.

The measured diameters of MNFs range is 0.34 $\mu$m - 1.4 $\mu$m. In the gas-flame technique, we design the pulling parameters in a four-step process to achieve the desired diameter of MNFs. The single-mode fiber is adiabatically tapered using high-precision stages while heating the fiber with hydrogen-oxygen flame. The measured diameters of pulled MNFs range is 0.48 $\mu$m - 0.53 $\mu$m, showing good correspondence with the designed diameters. Due to the strong confinement of the field around the MNF, it has diverse applications in various fields, such as sensing, nanophotonics, quantum optics, quantum photonics, and nonlinear optics.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01761' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01761' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 50.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.5</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>The article discusses the fabrication and characterization of optical micro/nanofibers, which is somewhat related to FSOC but lacks direct relevance to adaptive optics or atmospheric turbulence.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>9. Asymmetrical estimator for training encapsulated deep photonic neural networks</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scalable isomorphic physical neural networks (PNNs) are emerging NN acceleration paradigms for their high-bandwidth, in-propagation computation. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training is often the industry standard for its robustness and fast gradient convergences, existing BP-PNN training methods need to truncate the propagation of analogue signal at each layer and acquire accurate hidden neuron readouts for deep networks. This compromises the incentive of PNN for fast in-propagation processing. In addition, the required readouts introduce massive bottlenecks due to the conversions between the analogue-digital interfaces to shuttle information across. These factors limit both the time and energy efficiency during training. Here we introduce the asymmetrical training (AT) method, a BP-based method that can perform training on an encapsulated deep network, where the information propagation is maintained within the analogue domain until the output layer. AT's minimum information access bypass analogue-digital interface bottleneck wherever possible. For any deep network structure, AT offers significantly improved time and energy efficiency compared to existing BP-PNN methods, and scales well for large network sizes. We demonstrated AT's error-tolerant and calibration-free training for encapsulated integrated photonic deep networks to achieve near ideal BP performances. AT's well-behaved training is demonstrated repeatably across different datasets and network structures</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18458' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18458' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 50.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.5</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this paper discusses photonic neural networks, it focuses on the training process rather than hardware or communication aspects relevant to FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>10.

Optimized waveguides for mid-infrared lab-on-chip systems: A rigorous design approach</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy is a well-established technique for non-destructive quantitative molecular analysis. Waveguide-integrated sensors provide a particularly compact solution operating with reduced sample volumes while exhibiting exquisite molecular selectivity, sensitivity, and ultra-low limits of detection. Recent advances in mid-infrared technologies along with the integration of on-chip sources, detectors and microfluidics, have brought mid-infrared lab-on-chip systems closer to reality. A variety of material platforms has been proposed for the implementation of such systems. However, the lack of a consistent waveguide design approach renders a fair comparison between different alternatives - and a deliberate material selection - challenging, limiting the development of optimized on-chip spectroscopic devices. In the present study, a systematic waveguide design approach has been developed, facilitating evanescent field absorption-based sensing, in particular for aqueous analytes. Our strategy enables a rigorous comparison of several state-of-the-art thin-film waveguides using parametric expressions to predict the achievable limits of detection of the sensing system, while indicating optimum waveguide dimensions and absorption pathlengths, pivotal for the development of next-generation mid-infrared lab-on-chip devices.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08039' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08039' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 40.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.4</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>The article focuses on optimized waveguides for mid-infrared lab-on-chip systems, which is somewhat related to photonic components but does not directly address FSOC or the researcher's main interests.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>12. Spectrum Prediction With Deep 3D Pyramid Vision Transformer Learning</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based task-driven spectrum prediction framework, named DeepSPred. The DeepSPred comprises a feature encoder and a task predictor, where the encoder extracts spectrum usage pattern features, and the predictor configures different networks according to the task requirements to predict future spectrum. Based on the Deep- SPred, we first propose a novel 3D spectrum prediction method combining a flow processing strategy with 3D vision Transformer (ViT, i.e., Swin) and a pyramid to serve possible applications such as spectrum monitoring task, named 3D-SwinSTB. 3D-SwinSTB unique 3D Patch Merging ViT-to-3D ViT Patch Expanding and pyramid designs help the model accurately learn the potential correlation of the evolution of the spectrogram over time. Then, we propose a novel spectrum occupancy rate (SOR) method by redesigning a predictor consisting exclusively of 3D convolutional and linear layers to serve possible applications such as dynamic spectrum access (DSA) task, named 3D-SwinLinear. Unlike the 3D-SwinSTB output spectrogram, 3D-SwinLinear projects the spectrogram directly as the SOR. Finally, we employ transfer learning (TL) to ensure the applicability of our two methods to diverse spectrum services. The results show that our 3D-SwinSTB outperforms recent benchmarks by more than 5%, while our 3D-SwinLinear achieves a 90% accuracy, with a performance improvement exceeding 10%.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06870' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06870' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 35.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.35</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this paper involves deep learning for spectrum prediction, it is not directly related to adaptive optics, wavefront sensing, or laser communication in FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>13. All-Optical Azimuthal Trapping of Dissipative Kerr Multi-Solitons for Relative Noise Suppression</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal cavity solitons, or dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in integrated microresonators, are essential for deployable metrology technologies. Such applications favor the lowest noise state, typically the single-DKS state where one soliton is in the resonator. Other multi-DKS states can also be reached, offering better conversion efficiency and thermal stability, potentially simplifying DKS-based technologies. Yet they exhibit more noise due to relative soliton jitter, and are usually not compatible with targeted applications. We demonstrate that Kerr-induced synchronization, an all-optical trapping technique, can azimuthally pin the multi-DKS state to a common reference field. This method ensures repetition rate noise independent of the number of solitons, making a multi-DKS state indistinguishable from a single-DKS state in that regard, akin to trapped-soliton molecule behavior. Supported by theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration in an integrated microresonator, this approach provides metrological capacity regardless of the number of cavity solitons, benefiting numerous DKS-based metrology applications.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08253' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08253' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 30.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper focuses on all-optical azimuthal trapping of dissipative Kerr multi-solitons, which does not directly relate to adaptive optics, optical communication, or atmospheric turbulence monitoring.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>14. Light scrambling and focal ratio degradation of thin multimode fibers with different core geometries</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The performance of fiber-fed astronomical spectrographs is highly influenced by the properties of fibers. The near-field and far-field scrambling characteristics have a profound impact on the line spread function (LSF) of the spectra. Focal ratio degradation (FRD) influences the output beam size, thereby affecting the throughput, as well as the size of the collimator and dispersion elements. While previous research has indicated that these properties depend on the shape of the fiber core and showed that non-circular core fibers can yield uniform near-field scrambling, the result remains inconclusive for far-field. In this study, we investigate the near-field and far-field scrambling properties, along with the FRD, of 50-micron core fibers with different core geometries. We find that in addition to excellent near-field scrambling, octagonal-core fibers can also produce more uniform far-field output when compared to circular-core fibers. They also have less FRD effect when being fed with a f/3 beam.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07961' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07961' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 30.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this article discusses light scrambling and focal ratio degradation in multimode fibers, it is not directly related to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>15. A Partial Near-infrared Guide Star Catalog for Thirty Meter Telescope Operations</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>At first light, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) near-infrared (NIR) instruments will be fed by a multiconjugate adaptive optics instrument known as the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS). NFIRAOS will use six laser guide stars to sense atmospheric turbulence in a volume corresponding to a field of view of 2', but natural guide stars (NGSs) will be required to sense tip/tilt and focus. To achieve high sky coverage (50% at the north Galactic pole), the NFIRAOS client instruments use NIR on-instrument wavefront sensors that take advantage of the sharpening of the stars by NFIRAOS. A catalog of guide stars with NIR magnitudes as faint as 22 mag in the J band (Vega system), covering the TMT-observable sky, will be a critical resource for the efficient operation of NFIRAOS, and no such catalog currently exists. Hence, it is essential to develop such a catalog by computing the expected NIR magnitudes of stellar sources identified in deep optical sky surveys using their optical magnitudes. This paper discusses the generation of a partial NIR Guide Star Catalog (IRGSC), similar to the final IRGSC for TMT operations. The partial catalog is generated by applying stellar atmospheric models to the optical data of stellar sources from the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) optical data and then computing their expected NIR magnitudes. We validated the computed NIR magnitudes of the sources in some fields by using the available NIR data for those fields. We identified the remaining challenges of this approach. We outlined the path for producing the final IRGSC using the Pan-STARRS data. We have named the Python code to generate the IRGSC as irgsctool, which generates a list of NGS for a field using optical data from the Pan-STARRS 3pi survey and also a list of NGSs having observed NIR data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey if they are available.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08180' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08180' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 30.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article focuses on creating a guide star catalog for the Thirty Meter Telescope, which is relevant to ground-based astronomy but not directly related to Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC).</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>16. Perturbation theory for resonant states near a bound state in the continuum</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we develop a perturbation theory to analyze resonant states near a bound state in the continuum (BIC) in photonic crystal slabs. The theory allows us to rigorously determine the asymptotic behavior of $Q$-factor and the far-field polarization. We show that the resonant states near a BIC can be nearly circularly polarized if the scattering matrix is subject to a certain condition. Moreover, our theory offers a novel perspective on super-BICs and provides a clear and precise condition to efficiently identify them in both symmetric and asymmetric structures without requiring a merging process. For practical applications, we find a super-BIC in a square lattice of cylinders on a dielectric substrate. Our theory addresses the non-Hermitian nature of the system, can be generalized to treat other structures that support BICs, and has potential applications in resonance and chiral optics.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08162' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08162' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 30.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper focuses on perturbation theory for resonant states, which is not directly related to adaptive optics or optical communication.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>17.

To overcome the limitations, we employ surface Green's functions combined with two efficient algorithms to obtain the ideal surface states for a semi-infinite system. They are further extended to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. Photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are taken as examples for demonstration and verification. The surface spectra obtained from our approach can be directly used for comparison with experimental observables. Our approach enriches the efficient computational tools for topological photonics and acoustics.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07929' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07929' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 30.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this article discusses efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic systems, it does not directly relate to FSOC or the researcher's specific interests.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>18.

GSVD-NMF: Recovering Missing Features in Non-negative Matrix Factorization</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an important tool in signal processing and widely used to separate mixed sources into their components. However, NMF is NP-hard and thus may fail to discover the ideal factorization; moreover, the number of components may not be known in advance and thus features may be missed or incompletely separated. To recover missing components from under-complete NMF, we introduce GSVD-NMF, which proposes new components based on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) between preliminary NMF results and the SVD of the original matrix. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that GSVD-NMF often recovers missing features from under-complete NMF and helps NMF achieve better local optima.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08260' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08260' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 30.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this paper discusses Non-negative Matrix Factorization, it is not directly related to optical engineering topics such as adaptive optics or atmospheric turbulence.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>20. Omnidirectional gradient force optical trapping in dielectric nanocavities by inverse design</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optical trapping enables precise control of individual particles of different sizes, such as atoms, molecules, or nanospheres. Optical tweezers provide free-space omnidirectional optical trapping of objects in laboratories around the world. As an alternative to standard macroscopic setups based on lenses, which are inherently bound by the diffraction limit, plasmonic and photonic nanostructures promise trapping by near-field optical effects on the extreme nanoscale. However, the practical design of lossless waveguide-coupled nanostructures capable of trapping sub-wavelength-sized particles in all spatial directions has until now proven insurmountable. In this work, we demonstrate an omnidirectional optical trap realized by inverse-designing fabrication-ready integrated dielectric nanocavities. The sub-wavelength optical trap is designed to rely solely on the gradient force and is thus particle-size agnostic. In particular, we show how a trapped particle with a radius of 15 nm experiences a force strong enough to overcome room-temperature thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, through the robust inverse design framework, we tailor manufacturable devices operating at short-wave infrared and near-infrared frequencies. Our results open a new regime of levitated optical trapping by achieving a deep trapping potential capable of trapping single sub-wavelength particles in all directions using optical gradient forces. We anticipate potentially groundbreaking applications of the optimized optical trapping system for biomolecular analysis in aqueous environments, levitated cavity-optomechanics, and cold atom physics, constituting an important step towards realizing integrated bio-nanophotonics and mesoscopic quantum mechanical experiments.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15102' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15102' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 30.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this article discusses optical trapping and inverse design, it's focused on nanocavities rather than FSOC or adaptive optics applications.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>21.

The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their their large-scale environment. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim0.35-10$ mm) single dish; The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the full design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU-funded project. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding design requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, combine novel concepts with lessons learned from past experience. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms. AtLAST will be capable of $3^\circ\,\rm s^{-1}$ scanning and $1^\circ\,\rm s^{-2}$ acceleration, and aims to feature a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m half wavefront error under static deformations, allowing observations up to $\approx 950$~GHz. Crucially, AtLAST will be a sustainable, visionary facility that will allow upgrades for decades to come. While some aspects require further testing, prototyping, and field demonstrations, we estimate that the design will be construction-ready this decade.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18645' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 20.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article presents the conceptual design of a large aperture submillimeter telescope, which is not directly related to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>24. Exploiting Multipath Information for Integrated Localization and Sensing via PHD Filtering</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate localization and perception are pivotal for enhancing the safety and reliability of vehicles. However, current localization methods suffer from reduced accuracy when the line-of-sight (LOS) path is obstructed, or a combination of reflections and scatterings is present. In this paper, we present an integrated localization and sensing method that delivers superior performance in complex environments while being computationally efficient. Our method uniformly leverages various types of multipath components (MPCs) through the lens of random finite sets (RFSs), encompassing reflections, scatterings, and their combinations. This advancement eliminates the need for the multipath identification step and streamlines the filtering process by removing the necessity for distinct filters for different multipath types, a requirement that was critical in previous research. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both robustness and effectiveness, particularly in complex environments where the LOS MPC is obscured and in situations involving clutter and missed detection of MPC measurements.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15538' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15538' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 20.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper focuses on integrated localization and sensing using PHD filtering, which is not directly relevant to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>25.

Euclid Preparation. Cosmic Dawn Survey: Data release 1 multiwavelength catalogues for Euclid Deep Field North and Euclid Deep Field Fornax</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Cosmic Dawn Survey (DAWN survey) provides multiwavelength (UV/optical to mid-IR) data across the combined 59 deg$^{2}$ of the Euclid Deep and Auxiliary fields (EDFs and EAFs). Here, the first public data release (DR1) from the DAWN survey is presented. DR1 catalogues are made available for a subset of the full DAWN survey that consists of two Euclid Deep fields: Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N) and Euclid Deep Field Fornax (EDF-F). The DAWN survey DR1 catalogues do not include $Euclid$ data as they are not yet public for these fields. Nonetheless, each field has been covered by the ongoing Hawaii Twenty Square Degree Survey (H20), which includes imaging from CFHT MegaCam in the new $u$ filter and from Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) in the $griz$ filters. Each field is further covered by $Spitzer$/IRAC 3.6-4.5$\mu$m imaging spanning 10 deg$^{2}$ and reaching $\sim$25 mag AB (5$\sigma$). All present H20 imaging and all publicly available imaging from the aforementioned facilities are combined with the deep $Spitzer$/IRAC data to create source catalogues spanning a total area of 16.87 deg$^{2}$ in EDF-N and 2.85 deg$^{2}$ in EDF-F for this first release. Photometry is measured using The Farmer, a well-validated model-based photometry code. Photometric redshifts and stellar masses are computed using two independent codes for modeling spectral energy distributions: EAZY and LePhare. Photometric redshifts show good agreement with spectroscopic redshifts ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.5, \eta < 8\%$ at $i < 25$). Number counts, photometric redshifts, and stellar masses are further validated in comparison to the COSMOS2020 catalogue. The DAWN survey DR1 catalogues are designed to be of immediate use in these two EDFs and will be continuously updated. Future data releases will provide catalogues of all EDFs and EAFs and include $Euclid$ data.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05296' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05296' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 20.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article presents multiwavelength catalogues for Euclid Deep Fields, but it does not directly relate to FSOC, adaptive optics, or other specific interests of the researcher.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>28. On-sky demonstration of an ultra-fast intensity interferometry instrument utilising hybrid single photon counting detectors</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intensity interferometry is a reemerging astronomical technique for performing high angular resolution studies at visible wavelengths, benefiting immensely from the recent improvements in (single) photon detection instrumentation. Contrary to direct imaging or amplitude interferometry, intensity interferometry correlates light intensities rather than light amplitudes, circumventing atmospheric seeing limitations at the cost of reduced sensitivity. In this paper we present measurements with the 1.04 m Omicron telescope of C2PU (Centre P\'edagogique Plan\`ete Univers) at the Calern Observatory in the south of France featuring hybrid single photon counting detectors (HPDs). We successfully measured photon bunching from temporal correlations of three different A-type stars - Vega, Altair and Deneb - in the blue at 405 nm. In all cases the observed coherence time fits well to both the pre-calculated expectations as well as the values measured in preceding laboratory tests. The best signal to noise ratio (SNR), with a value of 12, is obtained for Vega for an observation time of 12.1 h. The combination of HPDs and time to digital converter (TDC) results in a timing jitter of the detection system < 50 ps. Our setup demonstrates stable and efficient detection of the starlight owed to the large active area of the HPDs. Utilizing a new class of large area single photon detectors based on multichannel plate amplification, high resolution spatial intensity interferometry experiments are within reach at 1 m diameter class telescopes within one night of observation time for bright stars.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08173' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08173' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 20.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article presents an on-sky demonstration of an ultra-fast intensity interferometry instrument, which is not directly related to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>29.

Identifying Black Holes Through Space Telescopes and Deep Learning</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The EHT has captured a series of images of black holes. These images could provide valuable information about the gravitational environment near the event horizon. However, accurate detection and parameter estimation for candidate black holes are necessary. This paper explores the potential for identifying black holes in the ultraviolet band using space telescopes. We establish a data pipeline for generating simulated observations and present an ensemble neural network model for black hole detection and parameter estimation. The model achieves mean average precision [0.5] values of 0.9176 even when reaching the imaging FWHM ($\theta_c$) and maintains the detection ability until $0.54\theta_c$. The parameter estimation is also accurate. These results indicate that our methodology enables super-resolution recognition. Moreover, the model successfully detects the shadow of M87* from background noise and other celestial bodies and estimates its inclination and positional angle.

Correlating Visual Characteristics and Cryogenic Performance of Superconducting Detectors</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cryogenic characterization of transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers is a time- and labor-intensive process. As new experiments deploy larger and larger arrays of TES bolometers, the testing process will become more of a bottleneck. Thus it is desirable to develop a method for evaluating detector performance at room temperature. One possibility is using machine learning to correlate detectors' visual appearance with their cryogenic properties. Here, we use three engineering-grade TES bolometer wafers from the production cycle for SPT-3G, the current receiver on the South Pole Telescope, to train and test such an algorithm. High-resolution images of these TES bolometers were captured and relevant features were calculated from the images. Cryogenic performance metrics, including a detector's ability to tune and superconducting parameters such as normal resistance, critical temperature, and transition width, were also measured. A random forest algorithm was trained to predict these performance metrics from the visual features. Analysis of the images proved highly successful. While the ability of the random forest algorithm to predict cryogenic features was limited with the chosen set of input image features, it is possible that an increase in data volume or the addition of more image features will solve this problem.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14242' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14242' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 10.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.1</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article discusses the correlation between visual characteristics and cryogenic performance of superconducting detectors, which is not directly related to FSOC or optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>32.

Discovered objects will be identified early enough in JWST's lifetime to leverage its unparalleled capabilities for long-term atmospheric characterisation, and will uniquely complement the known population of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Furthermore, this survey will constrain the occurrence of the novel wide sub-Jovian exoplanet population, informing multiple theories of planetary formation and evolution. Observations with NIRCam F200W+F444W dual-band coronagraphy will readily provide sub-Jupiter mass sensitivities beyond ~0.4" (F444W) and can also be used to rule out some contaminating background sources (F200W). At this large scale, targets can be sequenced by spectral type to enable robust self-referencing for PSF subtraction. This eliminates the need for dedicated reference observations required by GO programs and dramatically increases the overall science observing efficiency. With an exposure of ~30 minutes per target, the sub-Jupiter regime can be explored across 250 targets for ~400 hours of exposure time including overheads. An additional, pre-allocated, ~100 hours of observing time would enable rapid multi-epoch vetting of the lowest mass detections (which are undetectable in F200W).

Impact of gravitational waveform model systematics on the measurement of the Hubble constant</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Matching gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron stars with theoretical model predictions reveals important information about the sources, such as the masses and the distance to the stars. The latter can be used to determine the Hubble constant, the rate at which the Universe expands. One general problem of all astrophysical measurements is that theoretical models only approximate the real underlying physics, which can lead to systematic uncertainties introducing biases. However, the extent of this bias for the distance measurement due to uncertainties of gravitational waveform models is unknown. In this study, we analyze a synthetic population of 38 binary neutron star sources measured with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo at design sensitivity. We employ a set of four different waveform models and estimate model-dependent systematic biases on the extraction of the Hubble constant using the bright siren method. Our results indicate that systematic biases are below statistical uncertainties for the current generation of gravitational-wave detectors.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18158' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18158' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 10.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.1</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>The article focuses on gravitational waveform modeling and Hubble constant measurement, which is not directly related to Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) or the researcher's interests in adaptive optics, optical communication, and atmospheric turbulence.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>36.

We present a set of coronagraphic images taken using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) coronagraph on the Hubble space telescope at a small inner working angle to detect a predicted warm inner debris disk inside 1". We used three different post-processing approaches; Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Karhunen-Lo`eve Image Processing (KLIP), and Classical reference differential imaging (RDI), to best optimize reference star subtraction, and find that NMF performed the best overall while KLIP produced the absolute best contrast inside 1". We present limits on scattered light from warm dust, with constraints on surface brightness at 6 mJy/as$^2$ at our inner working angle of 0.6".

A Self-Healing Magnetic-Array-Type Current Sensor with Data-Driven Identification of Abnormal Magnetic Measurement Units</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Magnetic-array-type current sensors have garnered increasing popularity owing to their notable advantages, including broadband functionality, a large dynamic range, cost-effectiveness, and compact dimensions. However, the susceptibility of the measurement error of one or more magnetic measurement units (MMUs) within the current sensor to drift significantly from the nominal value due to environmental factors poses a potential threat to the measurement accuracy of the current sensor. In light of the need to ensure sustained measurement accuracy over the long term, this paper proposes an innovative self-healing approach rooted in cyber-physics correlation. This approach aims to identify MMUs exhibiting abnormal measurement errors, allowing for the exclusive utilization of the remaining unaffected MMUs in the current measurement process. To achieve this, principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to discern the primary component, arising from fluctuations of the measured current, from the residual component, attributed to the drift in measurement error. This analysis is conducted by scrutinizing the measured data obtained from the MMUs. Subsequently, the squared prediction error (SPE) statistic (also called $Q$ statistic) is deployed to individually identify any MMU displaying abnormal behavior. The experimental results demonstrate the successful online identification of abnormal MMUs without the need for a standard magnetic field sensor. By eliminating the contributions from the identified abnormal MMUs, the accuracy of the current measurement is effectively preserved.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11419' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11419' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 10.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.1</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper discusses a self-healing magnetic-array-type current sensor, which is not related to optical engineering or FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>39. Gauge-invariant optical selection rules for excitons</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Presently, the optical selection rules for excitons under circularly-polarized light are manifestly gauge-dependent. Recently, Fernando et al. introduced a gauge-invariant, quantized interband index. This index may improve the topological classification of material excited states because it is intrinsically an inter-level quantity.

User-Centric Machine Learning for Resource Allocation in MPTCP-Enabled Hybrid LiFi and WiFi Networks</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>As an emerging paradigm of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) towards 6G, the hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets) have potential to explore the complementary advantages of the optical and radio spectra. Like other cooperation-native HetNets, HLWNets face a crucial load balancing (LB) problem due to the heterogeneity of access points (APs). The existing literature mostly formulates this problem as joint AP selection and resource allocation (RA), presuming that each user equipment (UE) is served by one AP at a time, under the constraint of the traditional transmission control protocol (TCP). In contrast, multipath TCP (MPTCP), which allows for the simultaneous use of multiple APs, can significantly boost the UE's throughput as well as enhancing its network resilience. However, the existing TCP-based LB methods, particularly those aided by machine learning, are not suitable for the MPTCP scenario. In this paper, we discuss the challenges when developing learning-aided LB in MPTCP-enabled HLWNets, and propose a novel user-centric learning model to tackle this tricky problem. Unlike the conventional network-centric learning methods, the proposed method determines the LB solution for a single target UE, rendering low complexity and high flexibility in practical implementations. Results show that the proposed user-centric approach can greatly outperform the network-centric learning method. Against the TCP-based LB method such as game theory, the proposed method can increase the throughput of HLWNets by up to 40\%.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07770' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07770' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 0.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper is about resource allocation in hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks, which is not directly related to FSOC or the specific interests mentioned.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>42. Imaging coupled vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Molecular dynamics triggered by interaction with light often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Characterizing the resulting coupled electronic and nuclear wave packet motion represents a severe challenge, even for small polyatomic systems. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) in combination with quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the role of the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. A conical intersection between these states couples the bending and asymmetric stretching coordinates, which is clearly reflected in the correlated fragment momenta. Our results suggest that multi-coincident CEI represents an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07958' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07958' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 0.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper focuses on molecular dynamics and does not relate to optical engineering, FSOC, or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>43. SPEED: Scalable Preprocessing of EEG Data for Self-Supervised Learning</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electroencephalography (EEG) research typically focuses on tasks with narrowly defined objectives, but recent studies are expanding into the use of unlabeled data within larger models, aiming for a broader range of applications. This addresses a critical challenge in EEG research. For example, Kostas et al. (2021) show that self-supervised learning (SSL) outperforms traditional supervised methods. Given the high noise levels in EEG data, we argue that further improvements are possible with additional preprocessing. Current preprocessing methods often fail to efficiently manage the large data volumes required for SSL, due to their lack of optimization, reliance on subjective manual corrections, and validation processes or inflexible protocols that limit SSL. We propose a Python-based EEG preprocessing pipeline optimized for self-supervised learning, designed to efficiently process large-scale data. This optimization not only stabilizes self-supervised training but also enhances performance on downstream tasks compared to training with raw data.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08065' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08065' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 0.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article is about EEG data preprocessing for self-supervised learning, which does not align with the researcher's interests in Adaptive Optics and FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>44. The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Monotonocity Principle states a monotonic relationship between a possibly non-linear material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator. The Monotonicity Principle (MP) has attracted great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods. Recently, with quite general assumptions, a MP in the presence of non linear materials has been established for elliptic PDE, such as those governing Electrical Resistance Tomography.
  Together with recently introduced imaging methods and algorithms based on MP, arises a fundamental question related to the Converse (of the MP). Indeed, the Converse of the MP is fundamental to define the theoretical limits of applicability of imaging methods and algorithms. Specifically, the Converse of the MP guarantees that the outer boundary of a nonlinear anomaly can be reconstructed by means of MP based imaging methods.
  In this paper, the Converse of the Monotonicity Principle for nonlinear anomaly embedded in a linear material is proved. The results is provided in a quite general setting for Electrical Resistance Tomography. Moreover, the nonlinear electrical conductivity of the anomaly, as function of the electric field, can be either bounded or not bounded from infinity and/or zero.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08040' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08040' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 0.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Not relevant as it deals with the inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions, not FSOC topics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>45. A Single Channel-Based Neonatal Sleep-Wake Classification using Hjorth Parameters and Improved Gradient Boosting</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sleep plays a crucial role in neonatal development. Monitoring the sleep patterns in neonates in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is imperative for understanding the maturation process. While polysomnography (PSG) is considered the best practice for sleep classification, its expense and reliance on human annotation pose challenges. Existing research often relies on multichannel EEG signals; however, concerns arise regarding the vulnerability of neonates and the potential impact on their sleep quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to neonatal sleep stage classification using a single-channel gradient boosting algorithm with Hjorth features. The gradient boosting parameters are fine-tuned using random search cross-validation (randomsearchCV), achieving an accuracy of 82.35% for neonatal sleep-wake classification. Validation is conducted through 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed algorithm not only enhances existing neonatal sleep algorithms but also opens avenues for broader applications.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07925' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07925' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 0.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Not relevant as it focuses on neonatal sleep-wake classification, not optical engineering or FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>46. Analog Spiking Neuron in CMOS 28 nm Towards Large-Scale Neuromorphic Processors</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The computational complexity of deep learning algorithms has given rise to significant speed and memory challenges for the execution hardware. In energy-limited portable devices, highly efficient processing platforms are indispensable for reproducing the prowess afforded by much bulkier processing platforms.
  In this work, we present a low-power Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron design fabricated in TSMC's 28 nm CMOS technology as proof of concept to build an energy-efficient mixed-signal Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NeuroSoC). The fabricated neuron consumes 1.61 fJ/spike and occupies an active area of 34 $\mu m^{2}$, leading to a maximum spiking frequency of 300 kHz at 250 mV power supply.
  These performances are used in a software model to emulate the dynamics of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Employing supervised backpropagation and a surrogate gradient technique, the resulting accuracy on the MNIST dataset, using 4-bit post-training quantization stands at 82.5\%.

RIS-Aided Bistatic Radar for Rapid NLOS Sensing in the Teraharetz Band</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we investigate a non-lineof-sight (NLOS) sensing problem at terahertz frequencies.

We employ a bistatic radar system and scan the obstructed area with RIS using hierarchical codebooks (HCB). Moreover, we propose an iterative maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) scheme to yield the optimum sensing accuracy, converging to Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We take band-specific effects such as diffraction and beam squint into account and show that these effects are relevant factors affecting localization performance in RIS-employed radar setups. The results show that under NLOS conditions, the system can still localize all the targets with very good accuracy using the RIS. The initial estimates obtained by the HCBs can provide centimeter-level accuracy, and when the optimal performance is needed, at the cost of a few extra transmissions, the proposed iterative MLE method improves the accuracy to sub-millimeter accuracy, yielding the position error bound.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08096' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08096' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 0.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this article discusses radar sensing, it is focused on the Terahertz band and does not directly relate to Adaptive Optics, optical communication, or laser communication.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>49. On the Spectral Efficiency of Movable and Rotary Access Points under Rician Fading</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) is a pivotal technology in present-day wireless communication systems. In such systems, a base station or Access Point (AP) is equipped with multiple antenna elements and serves multiple active devices simultaneously. Nevertheless, most of the works evaluating the performance of MU-MIMO systems consider APs with static antenna arrays, that is, without any movement capability. Recently, the idea of APs and antenna arrays that are able to move have gained traction among the research community. Many works evaluate the communications performance of antenna systems able to move on the horizontal plane. However, such APs require a very bulky, complex and expensive movement system. In this work, we propose a simpler and cheaper alternative: the utilization of rotary APs, i.e. APs that can rotate. We also analyze the performance of a system in which the AP is able to both move and rotate. The movements and/or rotations of the APs are computed in order to maximize the mean per-user achievable spectral efficiency, based on estimates of the locations of the active devices and using particle swarm optimization. We adopt a spatially correlated Rician fading channel model, and evaluate the resulting optimized performance of the different setups in terms of mean per-user achievable spectral efficiencies. Our numerical results show that both the optimal rotations and movements of the APs can provide substantial performance gains when the line-of-sight components of the channel vectors are strong. Moreover, the simpler rotary APs can outperform the movable APs when their movement area is constrained.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08112' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08112' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 0.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article is about Rician fading and movable access points, which are not relevant to the researcher's work in FSOC and adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>50. Heterogeneous System Design for Cell-Free Massive MIMO in Wideband Communications</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CFmMIMO) offers uniform service quality through distributed access points (APs), yet unresolved issues remain. This paper proposes a heterogeneous system design that goes beyond the original CFmMIMO architecture by exploiting the synergy of a base station (BS) and distributed APs. Users are categorized as near users (NUs) and far users (FUs) depending on their proximity to the BS. The BS serves the NUs, while the APs cater to the FUs. Through activating only the closest AP of each FU, the use of downlink pilots is enabled, thereby enhancing performance. This heterogeneous design outperforms other homogeneous massive MIMO configurations, demonstrating superior sum capacity while maintaining comparable user-experienced rates. Moreover, it lowers the costs associated with AP installations and reduces signaling overhead for the fronthaul network.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08132' class='button'>Read More</a><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08132' class='button'>PDF</a><div class='rating-bar-container'><div class='rating-bar' style='width: 0.0%'></div></div><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Not directly relevant as it focuses on heterogeneous system design for cell-free massive MIMO in wideband communications, not FSOC-specific topics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>51. On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs.
