Achieving Practical OAM Based Wireless Communications With Misaligned Transceiver</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has attracted much attention for radio vortex wireless communications due to the orthogonality among different OAM-modes. To maintain the orthogonality among different OAM modes at the receiver, the strict alignment between transmit and receive antennas is highly demanded. However, it is not practical to guarantee the transceiver alignment in wireless communications. The phase turbulence, resulting from the misaligned transceivers, leads to serious inter-mode interference among different OAM modes and therefore fail for signals detection of multiple OAM modes at the receiver. To achieve practical OAM based wireless communications, in this paper we investigate the radio vortex wireless communications with misaligned transmit and receive antennas. We propose a joint Beamforming and Pre-detection (BePre) scheme, which uses two unitary matrices to convert the channel matrix into the equivalent circulant matrix for keeping the orthogonality among OAM-modes at the receiver. Then, the OAM signals can be detected with the mode-decomposition scheme at the misaligned receiver. Extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate that our developed joint BePre scheme can efficiently detect the signals of multiple OAM-modes for the misaligned transceiver and can significantly increase the spectrum efficiency.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07105'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07105'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.9</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article directly relates to OAM-based wireless communications and misaligned transceivers, which is of interest to the researcher.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>2. Free electron topological bound state induced by light beam with a twisted wavefront</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in ultrafast electron emission, microscopy, and diffraction have demonstrated a remarkable ability to manipulate free electrons with quantum coherence using light beams. Here, we present a framework for exploring free electron quantum number in ultrafast electron-light interactions. We derive an explicit Jackiw-Rebbi solution for a low-energy free electron wavefunction subjected to a spatiotemporally twisted laser field, resulting in a flying topologically protected bound state with a quantum number of e/2 - termed a "half-electron". This flying bound state is dispersion-free due to its topological nature. We demonstrate the topological confinement and pair generation mechanism of half-electrons in free space, expanding their domain beyond the topological states typically found in solids and photonics. This advancement enhances our understanding of emulating exotic quantum and topological effects with low-energy free electrons.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00723'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00723'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.8</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>The concept of a twisted wavefront is relevant to adaptive optics and wavefront sensing, thus potentially interesting for the researcher.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>3. 3D Anderson localization of light in disordered systems of dielectric particles</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the results of full wave numerical simulations of light transmission by layers of irregular dielectric particles that demonstrate 3D Anderson localization of light in disordered uncorrelated discrete media. Our simulations show that a high degree of disorder in a dense layer prevents transverse spreading of a propagating beam and allows anomalous conservation of its initial polarization state. A transition from the purely diffusive regime to a non-exponential time dependence when approaching the Ioffe-Regel condition is observed in short pulse transmission measurements. Along with this, the transmission spectrum is consistent with the Thouless criterion. The effect depends on the turbidity of the layer: increasing the volume fraction and the refractive index leads to the enhancement of the non-exponential behavior caused by the disorder in the medium which is a clear signature of Anderson localization.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14393'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14393'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.5</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Deals with Anderson localization of light in disordered systems, which has some relevance to atmospheric turbulence monitoring but lacks direct focus on adaptive optics or FSOC communication.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>4. Rapid stochastic spatial light modulator calibration and pixel crosstalk optimisation</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Holographic light potentials generated by phase-modulating liquid-crystal spatial light modulators (SLMs) are widely used in quantum technology applications. Accurate calibration of the wavefront and intensity profile of the laser beam at the SLM display is key to the high fidelity of holographic potentials. Here, we present a new calibration technique that is faster than previous methods while maintaining the same level of accuracy. By employing stochastic optimisation and random speckle intensity patterns, we calibrate a digital twin that accurately models the experimental setup. This approach allows us to measure the wavefront at the SLM to within $\lambda /170$ in ~ 5 minutes using only 10 SLM phase patterns, a significant speedup over state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, our digital twin models pixel crosstalk on the liquid-crystal SLM, enabling rapid calibration of model parameters and reducing the error in light potentials by a factor of ~ 5 without losing efficiency. Our fast calibration technique will simplify the implementation of high-fidelity light potentials in, for example, quantum-gas microscopes and neutral-atom tweezer arrays where high-NA objectives and thermal lensing can deform the wavefront significantly. Applications in the field of holographic displays that require high image fidelity will benefit from the novel pixel crosstalk calibration, especially for displays with a large field of view and increased SLM diffraction angles.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07672'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07672'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.5</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper focuses on spatial light modulator calibration and pixel crosstalk optimization, which is relevant to adaptive optics but lacks direct connection to the researcher's specific interests in FSOC and atmospheric turbulence.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>5.

Time-Domain Bound States in the Continuum</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the concept of time-domain bound states in continuum. We show that a rapid judiciously-designed temporal modulation of the refractive index in a spatially homogenous medium gives rise to a bound state in time embedded in a continuum of wavenumbers. Mathematically, these bound states in the continuum (BIC) are analytic solutions of the Maxwell equations in time and one-dimensional space. Our results show the potential to extend known wave phenomena in space to the temporal domain, providing new avenues for light-matter interactions in time-varying media.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06771'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06771'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.5</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While it involves wave phenomena, it is not directly related to adaptive optics or optical communication systems.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>7. Complexity of chaotic optical frequency combs</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The dynamics of a single-mode semiconductor laser induced by the optical injection of a frequency comb are analyzed through the lens of complexity. In particular, the focus is dynamics outside the injection-locking region. Permutation entropy (P.E.) and chaos bandwidth (CBW) are used to quantify complexity. Various numerically simulated system outputs across the frequency detuning range and for different injection strengths are considered. Numerically simulated outputs from a single-mode injection system in the absence of comb injection are compared to comment on the origin of the reported complexity. Furthermore, experimental outputs are used to confirm the findings. Despite the presence of periodic dynamics originating from the frequency comb, the presented system generates remarkably high complex outputs with P.E. up to 0.99 maintained over an extended period of observation and long timescales with CBW up to 25 GHz.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06861'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06861'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.4</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Focuses on the chaotic behavior of frequency combs, not directly relevant to adaptive optics or atmospheric turbulence monitoring.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>8. Chiral topological light for detecting robust enantio-sensitive observables</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The topological response of matter to electromagnetic fields is a property in high demand in materials design and metrology due to its robustness against noise and decoherence, stimulating recent advances in ultrafast photonics. Embedding topological properties into the enantio-sensitive optical response of chiral molecules could therefore enhance the efficiency and robustness of chiral optical discrimination. Here we achieve such a topological embedding by introducing the concept of chiral topological light~-- a light beam which displays chirality locally, with an azimuthal distribution of its handedness described globally by a topological charge. The topological charge is mapped onto the azimuthal intensity modulation of the non-linear optical response, where enantio-sensitivity is encoded into its spatial rotation. The spatial rotation is robust against intensity fluctuations and imperfect local polarization states of the driving field. Our theoretical results show that chiral topological light enables detection of percentage-level enantiomeric excesses in randomly oriented mixtures of chiral molecules, opening a way to new, extremely sensitive and robust chiro-optical spectroscopies with attosecond time resolution.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10932'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10932'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.4</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While it involves light and chirality, this article is more suited for researchers in topological photonics rather than those focused on adaptive optics or FSOC communication.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>9. Beyond spectral resolution in optical sensing: Picometer-level precision with multispectral readout</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optical sensors offer precision, remote read-out, and immunity to electromagnetic interference but face adoption challenges due to complex and costly readout instrumentation, mostly based on high-resolution. This article challenges the notion that high spectral resolution is necessary for high performance optical sensing. We propose co-optimizing the linewidths of sensor and readout to achieve picometer-level precision using low-resolution multispectral detector arrays and incoherent light sources. This approach is validated in temperature sensing, fiber-tip refractive index sensing, and biosensing, achieving superior precision to high-resolution spectrometers. This paradigm change in readout will enable optical sensing systems with costs and dimensions comparable to electronic sensors.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07487'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07487'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.4</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper is on optical sensing with multispectral readout but does not directly relate to the researcher's interests in adaptive optics, wavefront sensing and control, or phase control.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>10. VIRUS-NeRF -- Vision, InfraRed and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autonomous mobile robots are an increasingly integral part of modern factory and warehouse operations. Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP. Overall, VIRUS-NeRF presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.

In-line fiber optic optofluidic sensor based on a fully open Fabry-Perot interferometer</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present an all-fiber, fully open Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) cavity that is suitable for fluidic measurement applications. Fabrication of the FPI involves the alignment and bonding of three optical fiber sections using either ceramic glue or low-temperature melting glass. The fabrication procedure allows the protection of the cleaved optical fiber end faces, which serve as the two mirrors of the FPI, from damage, thus ensuring the high visibility of the FPI sensor. The FPI's complete openness permits the analyte of interest fluids to flow smoothly into the cavity and interact directly with the light, obviating the need for additional assistance. The fabrication experiment demonstrates that the fabrication procedure can readily achieve a visibility of over 20 dB. Refractive index testing indicates that the sensor exhibits a sensitivity of over 1116 nm/RIU within the range of 1.334-1.375. A comparison of temperature investigations indicates that the fully open cavity FPI fabricated by bonding with low-temperature melting glass exhibits relatively lower temperature immunity than that bonded with ceramic glue. Both have a relatively low temperature fluctuation within the temperature range of 40{\deg}C-100{\deg}C, with less than 3 nm and 4.5 nm in the over 60{\deg}C changes, respectively. Our proposed fully open FPI is an economical, robust, and simple-to-fabricate structure with the potential for mass production. This renders it an appealing option for practical optofluidics applications.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07354'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07354'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article presents a fiber optic optofluidic sensor using an open Fabry-Perot interferometer, which is not directly related to adaptive optics or atmospheric turbulence in FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>13. Realization of Topology-controlled Photonic Cavities in a Valley Photonic Crystal</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We report an experimental realization of a new type of topology-controlled photonic cavities in valley photonic crystals by adopting judiciously oriented mirrors to localize the valley-polarized edge states along their propagation path. By using microwave frequency- and time-domain measurements, we directly observe the strong confinement of electromagnetic energy at the mirror surface due to the extended time delay required for the valley index flipping. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that both the degree of energy localization and quality factors of the topology-controlled photonic cavities are determined by the valley-flipping time which is controlled by the topology of the mirror. These results extend and complement the current design paradigm of topological photonic cavities.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07347'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07347'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this article deals with valley photonic crystals, it does not discuss adaptive optics or wavefront sensing and control relevant to FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>14. Micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap system with long-term alignment stability for mobile atomic quantum technologies</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quantum technologies extensively use laser light for state preparation, manipulation, and readout. For field applications, these systems must be robust and compact, driving the need for miniaturized and highly stable optical setups and system integration. In this work, we present a micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap setup, the $\mu$XODT, designed for trapping and cooling $^{87}\text{Rb}$. This fiber-coupled setup operates at $1064\,\text{nm}$ wavelength with up to $2.5\,\text{W}$ optical power and realizes a free-space crossed beam geometry. The $\mu$XODT precisely overlaps two focused beams ($w_0 \approx 33\,\mu\text{m}$) at their waists in a $45^\circ$ crossing angle, achieving a position difference $\leq 3.4\,\mu\text{m}$ and 0.998 power ratio between both beams with long-term stability. We describe the design and assembly process in detail, along with optical and thermal tests with temperatures of up to $65\,^\circ C$. The system's volume of $25\,\text{ml}$ represents a reduction of more than two orders of magnitude compared to typically used macroscopic setups, while demonstrating exceptional mechanical robustness and thermal stability. The $\mu$XODT is integrated with a $^{87}\text{Rb}$ 3D MOT setup, trapping $3 \times 10^5$ atoms from a laser-cooled atomic cloud, and has shown no signs of degradation after two years of operation.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07187'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07187'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper presents a micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap system for mobile atomic quantum technologies, which is not directly related to the researcher's interests in FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>15. Debiasing astro-Photometric Observations with Corrections Using Statistics (DePhOCUS)</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Photometric measurements allow the determination of an asteroid's absolute magnitude, which often represents the sole means to infer its size. Photometric observations can be obtained in a variety of filters that can be unique to a specific observatory. Those observations are then calibrated into specific bands with respect to reference star catalogs. In order to combine all the different measurements for evaluation, photometric observations need to be converted to a common band, typically V-band. Current band-correction schemes in use by IAU's Minor Planet Center, JPL's Center for Near Earth Object Studies and ESA's NEO Coordination Centre use average correction values for the apparent magnitude derived from photometry of asteroids as the corrections are dependent on the typically unknown spectrum of the object to be corrected. By statistically analyzing the photometric residuals of asteroids, we develop a new photometric correction scheme that does not only consider the band, but also accounts for reference catalog and observatory. We describe a new statistical photometry correction scheme for asteroid observations with debiased corrections. Testing this scheme on a reference group of asteroids, we see a 36% reduction in the photometric residuals. Moreover, the new scheme leads to a more accurate and debiased determination of the H-G magnitude system and, in turn, to more reliable inferred sizes. We discuss the significant shift in the corrections with this "DePhOCUS" debiasing system, its limitations, and the impact for photometric and physical properties of all asteroids, especially Near-Earth Objects.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07474'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07474'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article discusses debiasing astro-photometric observations, which is not directly relevant to free space optical communication or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>16. Bayesian Learning in a Nonlinear Multiscale State-Space Model</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ubiquity of multiscale interactions in complex systems is well-recognized, with development and heredity serving as a prime example of how processes at different temporal scales influence one another. This work introduces a novel multiscale state-space model to explore the dynamic interplay between systems interacting across different time scales, with feedback between each scale.

PeriodWave: Multi-Period Flow Matching for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, universal waveform generation tasks have been investigated conditioned on various out-of-distribution scenarios. Although GAN-based methods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they are vulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stage text-to-speech. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerful generative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of the limelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. Above all, there is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the natural periodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. In this paper, we propose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. First, we introduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodic features of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields. Additionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps to capture different periodic features of waveform signals. Although increasing the number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requires more computational costs. To reduce this issue, we also propose a single period-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel by period-wise batch inference. Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelet transform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveform signals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce the high-frequency noise for waveform generation. The experimental results demonstrated that our model outperforms the previous models both in Mel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks.

Double helical plasmonic antennas</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Plasmonic double helical antennas are a means to funnel circularly polarized states of light down to the nanoscale. Here, an existing design tool for single helices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas that combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional light emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides additional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The experimentally realized double helical antennas were studied regarding their polarization-dependent transmission behavior resulting in a large and broadband dissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an important tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum photonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future nanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14927'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14927'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Does not relate to adaptive optics, optical communication, or atmospheric turbulence.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>19. On the Parameter Selection of Phase-transmittance Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for Communication Systems</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the ever-evolving field of digital communication systems, complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) have become a cornerstone, delivering exceptional performance in tasks like equalization, channel estimation, beamforming, and decoding. Among the myriad of CVNN architectures, the phase-transmittance radial basis function neural network (PT-RBF) stands out, especially when operating in noisy environments such as 5G MIMO systems. Despite its capabilities, achieving convergence in multi-layered, multi-input, and multi-output PT-RBFs remains a daunting challenge. Addressing this gap, this paper presents a novel Deep PT-RBF parameter initialization technique. Through rigorous simulations conforming to 3GPP TS 38 standards, our method not only outperforms conventional initialization strategies like random, $K$-means, and constellation-based methods but is also the only approach to achieve successful convergence in deep PT-RBF architectures.

Orbital-Angular-Momentum Embedded Massive MIMO: Achieving Multiplicative Spectrum-Efficiency for mmWave Communications</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>By enabling very high bandwidth for radio communications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave), which can easily be integrated with massive-multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) due to small antenna size, has been attracting growing attention as a candidate for the fifth-generation (5G) and 5G-beyond wireless communications networks. On the other hand, the communication over the orthogonal states/modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a subset of the solutions offered by massive-MIMO communications. Traditional massive-MIMO based mmWave communications did not concern the potential spectrum-efficiency-gain (SE-gain) offered by orthogonal states of OAM. However, the highly expecting maximum SE-gain for OAM and massive-MIMO communications is the product of SE-gains offered by OAM and multiplexing-MIMO. In this paper, we propose the OAM-embedded-MIMO (OEM) communication framework to obtain the multiplicative SE-gain for joint OAM and massive-MIMO based mmWave wireless communications. We design the parabolic antenna for each uniform circular array antenna to converge OAM signals. Then, we develop the mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme to obtain the transmit signal on each OAM-mode of each transmit antenna. Also, we develop the OEM-water-filling power allocation policy to achieve the maximum multiplicative SE-gain for OEM communications. The extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate our developed parabolic antenna based converging method, mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme, and OEM-water-filling policy, showing that our proposed OEM mmWave communications can significantly increase the spectrum-efficiency as compared with traditional massive-MIMO based mmWave communications.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07103'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07103'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this article mentions Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), it is primarily focused on Massive MIMO and mmWave communications, which are not the main interests of the researcher.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>21. Coherent control of nonreciprocal optical properties of the defect modes in 1D defective photonic crystals with atomic doping</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate the spectral properties of photonic crystals, lacking parity-time (PT) symmetry, using scattering matrix formalism. We show using the symmetry properties of matrices that a defective photonic crystal, doped with three-level atoms, breaks PT symmetry. For the two defect modes lying in the bandgap region, both the reflection and the absorption become nonreciprocal, while the transmission remains reciprocal. We show that the relevant energy spectra do not exhibit exceptional points, thereby invalidating its necessity to achieve nonreciprocity in reflection and absorption. We further demonstrate how this nonreciprocity can be coherently controlled using the driving field and dissipation rates of the atoms.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07446'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07446'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.3</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this paper discusses photonic crystals, it focuses on atomic doping and nonreciprocal optical properties, which is not directly related to the researcher's interests in adaptive optics, atmospheric turbulence, or laser communication.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>22. Improving Radial Velocities by Marginalizing over Stars and Sky: Achieving 30 m/s RV Precision for APOGEE in the Plate Era</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The radial velocity catalog from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is unique in its simultaneously large volume and high precision as a result of its decade-long survey duration, multiplexing (600 fibers), and spectral resolution of $R \sim 22,500$. However, previous data reductions of APOGEE have not fully realized the potential radial velocity (RV) precision of the instrument. Here we present an RV catalog based on a new reduction of all 2.6 million visits of APOGEE DR17 and validate it against improved estimates for the theoretical RV performance. The core ideas of the new reduction are the simultaneous modeling of all components in the spectra, rather than a separate subtraction of point estimates for the sky, and a marginalization over stellar types, rather than a grid search for an optimum. We show that this catalog, when restricted to RVs measured with the same fiber, achieves noise-limited precision down to 30 m/s and delivers well-calibrated uncertainties.

After calibration, we achieve 47 m/s RV precision on the combined catalog with RVs measured with different fibers.

Realization of time-reversal invariant photonic topological Anderson insulators</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Disorder, which is ubiquitous in nature, has been extensively explored in photonics for understanding the fundamental principles of light diffusion and localization, as well as for applications in functional resonators and random lasers. Recently, the investigation of disorder in topological photonics has led to the realization of topological Anderson insulators characterized by an unexpected disorder-induced phase transition. However, the observed photonic topological Anderson insulators so far are limited to the time-reversal symmetry breaking systems. Here, we propose and realize a photonic quantum spin Hall topological Anderson insulator without breaking time-reversal symmetry. The disorder-induced topological phase transition is comprehensively confirmed through the theoretical effective Dirac Hamiltonian, numerical analysis of bulk transmission, and experimental examination of bulk and edge transmissions. We present the convincing evidence for the unidirectional propagation and robust transport of helical edge modes, which are the key features of nontrivial time-reversal invariant topological Anderson insulators. Furthermore, we demonstrate disorder-induced beam steering, highlighting the potential of disorder as a new degree of freedom to manipulate light propagation in magnetic-free systems.

Hybrid Magnonics with Localized Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as a promising direction for information propagation with preserved coherence. Due to high tunability of magnons, their interactions with microwave photons can be engineered to probe novel phenomena based on strong photon-magnon coupling. Improving the photon-magnon coupling strength can be done by tuning the structure of microwave resonators to better interact with the magnon counterpart. Planar resonators have been explored due to their potential for on-chip integration, but only common modes from stripline-based resonators have been used. Here, we present a microwave spiral resonator supporting the spoof localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and implement it to the investigation of photon-magnon coupling for hybrid magnonic applications. We showcase strong magnon-LSP photon coupling using a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet sphere. We discuss the dependence of the spiral resonator design to the engineering capacity of the photon mode frequency and spatial field distributions, via both experiment and simulation. By the localized photon mode profiles, the resulting magnetic field concentrates near the surface dielectrics, giving rise to an enhanced magnetic filling factor. The strong coupling and large engineering space render the spoof LSPs an interesting contender in developing novel hybrid magnonic systems and functionalities.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07197'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07197'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Does not focus on optical communication or adaptive optics; instead, it explores hybrid magnonics with localized spoof surface plasmon polaritons.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>30. $\pi$ mode lasing in the non-Hermitian Floquet topological system</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>$\pi$ modes are unique topological edge states appearing in Floquet systems with periodic modulations of the underlying lattice structure in evolution variable, such as dynamically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. These edge states are anomalous states usually appearing between Floquet replicas of the same band, even if standard topological index remains zero for this band. While linear and nonlinear $\pi$ modes were observed in conservative systems, they have never been studied in nonlinear regime in the non-Hermitian systems with structured gain and losses. Here we show that SSH waveguide array with periodically oscillating waveguide positions in propagation direction and with parity-time symmetric refractive index landscape, can support $\pi$ modes that are damped or amplified at different ends of the array. By including nonlinearity and nonlinear absorption into our continuous system, we achieve stable lasing in $\pi$ mode at one end of the array. The representative feature of this system is that lasing in it is thresholdless and it occurs even at low gain-loss amplitudes. The degree of localization of lasing $\pi$ modes can be flexibly controlled by the amplitude of transverse waveguide oscillations. This work therefore introduces a new type of topological Floquet laser and a route to manipulation of $\pi$ modes by structured gain and losses.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07323'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07323'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article focuses on Floquet topological systems, which is not directly related to photonic lanterns or laser communication in FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>31. Deep-sub-cycle attosecond optical pulses</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sub-cycle optical pulse is of great importance for ultrafast science and technology. While a narrower pulse can offer a higher temporal resolution, so far the pulse width has not exceeded the limit of half an optical cycle. Here we propose to break the half-cycle limit via inverse Compton scattering in a nano-slit optical mode, in which a deep-subwavelength-confined optical field can be converted into a deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse by high-energy free electrons flying through. Our calculations show that, with experimentally reachable conditions, a measurable deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse with a width narrower than half an optical cycle can be generated. Quantitatively, using a deep-subwavelength-confined 4.4-$\mu$m-wavelength 100-fs pulsed optical driving field and a 2-MeV 50-as 5-pC electron bunch, we can obtain an attosecond pulse with a peak frequency of 2.55 PHz, a pulse width of 99 as ($\sim$0.25 optical cycle), and a single-pulse photon number larger than 200 around the material damage threshold. Such pulses may open opportunities for studying light-matter interaction on the deep-sub-cycle level, and pave a way to unprecedented optical technology ranging from temporal super-resolution optical microscopy and spectroscopy to unconventional atom/molecule polarization and manipulation.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07306'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07306'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While attosecond optical pulses are fascinating, they do not directly relate to adaptive optics or atmospheric turbulence in FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>32. New Bounds on Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Corrections to the Chu-Harrington Limits</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit is incorrect. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n>ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07085'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper discusses antenna bandwidth and directivity, which is not directly related to the researcher's interests in optical communication or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>33.

Iterative Equalization of CPM With Unitary Approximate Message Passing</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continuous phase modulation (CPM) has extensive applications in wireless communications due to its high spectral and power efficiency.

This paper proposes an iterative receiver tailored for the detection of CPM signals over frequency selective fading channels. This design leverages the factor graph framework to integrate equalization, demodulation, and decoding functions. The equalizer employs the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm, while the unitary transformation is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the aid of a cyclic prefix (CP), thereby achieving low computational complexity while with high performance. For CPM demodulation and channel decoding, with belief propagation (BP), we design a message passing-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, and the message exchange between the demodulator, decoder and equalizer is elaborated. With proper message passing schedules, the receiver can achieve fast convergence. Simulation results show that compared with existing turbo receivers, the proposed receiver delivers significant performance enhancement with low computational complexity.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07385'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07385'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper discusses iterative equalization of CPM with unitary approximate message passing, which is related to signal processing but not specifically to adaptive optics or FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>36. Self-Supervised Scalable Deep Compressed Sensing</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising tool for reducing sampling costs. Current deep neural network (NN)-based CS methods face the challenges of collecting labeled measurement-ground truth (GT) data and generalizing to real applications. This paper proposes a novel $\mathbf{S}$elf-supervised s$\mathbf{C}$alable deep CS method, comprising a deep $\mathbf{L}$earning scheme called $\mathbf{SCL}$ and a family of $\mathbf{Net}$works named $\mathbf{SCNet}$, which does not require GT and can handle arbitrary sampling ratios and matrices once trained on a partial measurement set. Our SCL contains a dual-domain loss and a four-stage recovery strategy. The former encourages a cross-consistency on two measurement parts and a sampling-reconstruction cycle-consistency regarding arbitrary ratios and matrices to maximize data/information utilization. The latter can progressively leverage common signal prior in external measurements and internal characteristics of test samples and learned NNs to improve accuracy. SCNet combines both the explicit guidance from optimization algorithms with implicit regularization from advanced NN blocks to learn a collaborative signal representation.

Can We Improve Channel Reciprocity via Loop-back Compensation for RIS-assisted Physical Layer Key Generation</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) facilitates the extraction of unpredictable channel features for physical layer key generation (PKG), securing communications among legitimate users with symmetric keys. Previous works have demonstrated that channel reciprocity plays a crucial role in generating symmetric keys in PKG systems, whereas, in reality, reciprocity is greatly affected by hardware interference and RIS-based jamming attacks. This motivates us to propose LoCKey, a novel approach that aims to improve channel reciprocity by mitigating interferences and attacks with a loop-back compensation scheme, thus maximizing the secrecy performance of the PKG system. Specifically, our proposed LoCKey is capable of effectively compensating for the CSI non-reciprocity by the combination of transmit-back signal value and error minimization module. Firstly, we introduce the entire flowchart of our method and provide an in-depth discussion of each step. Following that, we delve into a theoretical analysis of the performance optimizations when our LoCKey is applied for CSI reciprocity enhancement. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LoCKey in improving channel reciprocity under various interferences for RIS-assisted wireless communications. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in both the rate of key generation assisted by the RIS and the consistency of the generated keys, showing great potential for the practical deployment of our LoCKey in future wireless systems.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17575'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17575'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this paper discusses improving channel reciprocity, it is focused on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) for physical layer key generation, which is not directly related to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>38.

Near-Field Localization with Antenna Arrays in the Presence of Direction-Dependent Mutual Coupling</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Localizing near-field sources considering practical arrays is a recent challenging topic for next generation wireless communication systems. Practical antenna array apertures with closely spaced elements exhibit direction-dependent mutual coupling (MC), which can significantly degrade the performance localization techniques. A conventional method for near-field localization in the presence of MC is the three-dimensional (3D) multiple signal classification technique, which, however, suffers from extremely high computational complexity. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) search alternatives have been presented, exhibiting increased complexity still for direction-dependent MC scenarios. In this paper, we devise a low complexity one-dimensional (1D) iterative method based on an oblique projection operator (IMOP) that estimates direction-dependent MC and the locations of multiple near-field sources. The proposed method first estimates the initial direction of arrival (DOA) and MC using the approximate wavefront model, and then, estimates the initial range of one near-field source using the exact wavefront model. Afterwards, at each iteration, the oblique projection operator is used to isolate components associated with one source from those of other sources. The DOA and range of this one source are estimated using the exact wavefront model and 1D searches. Finally, the direction-dependent MC is estimated for each pair of the estimated DOA and range. The performance of the proposed near-field localization approach is comprehensively investigated and verified using both a full-wave electromagnetic solver and synthetic simulations. It is showcased that our IMOP scheme performs almost similarly to a state-of-the-art approach but with a 42 times less computational complexity.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07202'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07202'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.2</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>Although this article involves antenna arrays and localization, it does not directly relate to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>40. Shannon Entropy Helps Optimize the Performance of a Frequency-Multiplexed Extreme Learning Machine</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowing the dynamics of neuromorphic photonic schemes would allow their optimization for controlled data-processing capability at possibly minimized energy consumption levels. In nonlinear substrates such as optical fibers or semiconductors, these dynamics can widely vary depending on each optical input encoded with information to process and are in general difficult to estimate. Thus, other approaches are required to optimize the schemes. Using a frequency-multiplexed fiber-based Extreme Learning Machine as an example for a classification task, I use Shannon entropy for optical power and introduce Shannon entropy for optical phase and spectrum, all averaged only over a small subset of the dataset to process. I show that the maximum and upper moderate optical power and phase entropies relate to the best data-processing capability of the Machine and, thus, can be used to find optimal system parameters such as fiber length, input power, and group-velocity dispersion in a more time-efficient manner than running numerical simulations emulating the scheme. Shannon entropy of the spectrum provides the information for what parameter space broadest possible frequency combs can be expected and is interesting from the perspective of frequency comb and supercontinuum generation.

Such conditions were: Administrations shall take practical measures to ensure the transmitting antennas of outdoor IMT base stations (BSs) are normally pointing below the true horizon when deployed within 10-10.5 GHz; additionally, the mechanical pointing needs to be at or below the horizon; Administrations shall use side lobe suppression techniques providing 29.5 dB of attenuation for elevation angles above 30 degrees where 0 degrees relates to the horizon and 90 degrees to the zenith, referenced to the maximum antenna gain at the boresight; The maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) emitted by an IMT base station shall not exceed 32 dB W/100 MHz.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07074'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07074'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.1</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>The article is about mobile cellular and satellite communication compatibility, which is not directly related to Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>44.

Multi-periodicity dependency Transformer based on spectrum offset for radio frequency fingerprint identification</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has emerged as a pivotal task for reliable device authentication.

Coordinated Spectral Efficiency Prediction for Real-World 5G CoMP Systems</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) systems incur substantial resource consumption due to the management of backhaul links and the coordination among various base stations (BSs). Accurate prediction of coordinated spectral efficiency (CSE) can guide the optimization of network parameters, resulting in enhanced resource utilization efficiency. However, characterizing the CSE is intractable due to the inherent complexity of the CoMP channel model and the diversity of the 5G dynamic network environment, which poses a great challenge for CSE prediction in real-world 5G CoMP systems. To address this challenge, in this letter, we propose a data-driven model-assisted approach. Initially, we leverage domain knowledge to preprocess the collected raw data, thereby creating a well-informed dataset. Within this dataset, we explicitly define the target variable and the input feature space relevant to channel statistics for CSE prediction. Subsequently, a residual-based network model is built to capture the high-dimensional non-linear mapping function from the channel statistics to the CSE. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by experimental results on real-world data.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07320'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07320'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper deals with Coordinated Spectral Efficiency Prediction for real-world 5G CoMP systems, which is not directly related to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>47. Consistency Based Weakly Self-Supervised Learning for Human Activity Recognition with Wearables</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the widely available embedded sensors in smartphones and other wearable devices make it easier to obtain data of human activities, recognizing different types of human activities from sensor-based data remains a difficult research topic in ubiquitous computing. One reason for this is that most of the collected data is unlabeled. However, many current human activity recognition (HAR) systems are based on supervised methods, which heavily rely on the labels of the data. We describe a weakly self-supervised approach in this paper that consists of two stages: (1) In stage one, the model learns from the nature of human activities by projecting the data into an embedding space where similar activities are grouped together; (2) In stage two, the model is fine-tuned using similarity information in a few-shot learning fashion using the similarity information of the data. This allows downstream classification or clustering tasks to benefit from the embeddings. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and show that our approach can help the clustering algorithm achieve comparable performance in identifying and categorizing the underlying human activities as pure supervised techniques applied directly to a corresponding fully labeled data set.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07282'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07282'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper focuses on human activity recognition using wearables, which is not related to Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>48.

Adaptive Basis Function Selection for Computationally Efficient Predictions</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Basis Function (BF) expansions are a cornerstone of any engineer's toolbox for computational function approximation which shares connections with both neural networks and Gaussian processes. Even though BF expansions are an intuitive and straightforward model to use, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity in the number of BFs if the predictive variance is to be computed. We develop a method to automatically select the most important BFs for prediction in a sub-domain of the model domain. This significantly reduces the computational complexity of computing predictions while maintaining predictive accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated using two numerical examples, where reductions up to 50-75% are possible without significantly reducing the predictive accuracy.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07480'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07480'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper discusses Adaptive Basis Function Selection for Computationally Efficient Predictions, which is not specifically relevant to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>50. Anisotropic Diffusion Model of Communication in 2D Biofilm</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>A biofilm is a microbial city. It consists of bacteria embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that functions as a protective barrier. Quorum sensing (QS) is a method of bacterial communication, where autoinducers (AIs) propagate via diffusion through the EPS and water channels within the biofilm. This diffusion process is anisotropic due to varying densities between the EPS and water channels. This study introduces a 2D anisotropic diffusion model for molecular communication (MC) within biofilms, analyzing information propagation between a point-to-point transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) in bounded space. The channel impulse response is derived using Green's function for concentration (GFC) and is validated with particle-based simulation (PBS). The outcomes reveal similar results for both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion when the TX is centrally located due to symmetry. However, anisotropic conditions lead to greater diffusion peaks when the TX is positioned off-center. Additionally, the propagation of AIs is inversely proportional to both overall biofilm size and and diffusion coefficient values. It is hypothesized that anisotropic diffusion supports faster responses to hostile environmental changes because signals can propagate faster from the edge of the biofilm to the center.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07626'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07626'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>The article is focused on communication in bacterial biofilm, which is not relevant to Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>51. LiPCoT: Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for Self-supervised Learning of Time Series Data via Language Models</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Language models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, their application to time series data, a crucial component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets.

Bearing Fault Diagnosis using Graph Sampling and Aggregation Network</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Bearing fault diagnosis technology has a wide range of practical applications in industrial production, energy and other fields. Timely and accurate detection of bearing faults plays an important role in preventing catastrophic accidents and ensuring product quality. Traditional signal analysis techniques and deep learning-based fault detection algorithms do not take into account the intricate correlation between signals, making it difficult to further improve detection accuracy. To address this problem, we introduced Graph Sampling and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) network and proposed GraphSAGE-based Bearing fault Diagnosis (GSABFD) algorithm. The original vibration signal is firstly sliced through a fixed size non-overlapping sliding window, and the sliced data is feature transformed using signal analysis methods; then correlations are constructed for the transformed vibration signal and further transformed into vertices in the graph; then the GraphSAGE network is used for training; finally the fault level of the object is calculated in the output layer of the network. The proposed algorithm is compared with five advanced algorithms in a real-world public dataset for experiments, and the results show that the GSABFD algorithm improves the AUC value by 5% compared with the next best algorithm.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07099'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07099'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This article is about fault diagnosis in mechanical systems, not related to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>53.

Alternating Deep Low-Rank Approach for Exponential Function Reconstruction and Its Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Applications</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Undersampling can accelerate the signal acquisition but at the cost of bringing in artifacts. Removing these artifacts is a fundamental problem in signal processing and this task is also called signal reconstruction. Through modeling signals as the superimposed exponential functions, deep learning has achieved fast and high-fidelity signal reconstruction by training a mapping from the undersampled exponentials to the fully sampled ones. However, the mismatch, such as the sampling rate of undersampling, the organ and the contrast of imaging, between the training and target data will heavily compromise the reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose Alternating Deep Low-Rank (ADLR), which combines deep learning solvers and classic optimization solvers. Experiments on the reconstruction of synthetic and realistic biomedical magnetic resonance signals demonstrate that ADLR can effectively mitigate the mismatch issue and achieve lower reconstruction errors than state-of-the-art methods.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13479'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13479'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This paper focuses on exponential function reconstruction for biomedical magnetic resonance applications, which is not relevant to adaptive optics or FSOC.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>55. Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields.

Using Explainable AI for EEG-based Reduced Montage Neonatal Seizure Detection</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The neonatal period is the most vulnerable time for the development of seizures. Seizures in the immature brain lead to detrimental consequences, therefore require early diagnosis. The gold-standard for neonatal seizure detection currently relies on continuous video-EEG monitoring; which involves recording multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) alongside real-time video monitoring within a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, video-EEG monitoring technology requires clinical expertise and is often limited to technologically advanced and resourceful settings. Cost-effective new techniques could help the medical fraternity make an accurate diagnosis and advocate treatment without delay. In this work, a novel explainable deep learning model to automate the neonatal seizure detection process with a reduced EEG montage is proposed, which employs convolutional nets, graph attention layers, and fully connected layers. Beyond its ability to detect seizures in real-time with a reduced montage, this model offers the unique advantage of real-time interpretability. By evaluating the performance on the Zenodo dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the presented model achieves an absolute improvement of 8.31% and 42.86% in area under curve (AUC) and recall, respectively.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16908'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16908'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>While this paper involves machine learning and EEG, it is focused on neonatal seizure detection using a reduced montage, which is not related to FSOC or adaptive optics.</p></div><div class='item-box'><h2>57. Clinical translation of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection in scalp electroencephalography: systematic review</h2><p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Machine learning algorithms for seizure detection have shown considerable diagnostic potential, with recent reported accuracies reaching 100%. Yet, only few published algorithms have fully addressed the requirements for successful clinical translation. This is, for example, because the properties of training data may limit the generalisability of algorithms, algorithm performance may vary depending on which electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition hardware was used, or run-time processing costs may be prohibitive to real-time clinical use cases. To address these issues in a critical manner, we systematically review machine learning algorithms for seizure detection with a focus on clinical translatability, assessed by criteria including generalisability, run-time costs, explainability, and clinically-relevant performance metrics. For non-specialists, the domain-specific knowledge necessary to contextualise model development and evaluation is provided. It is our hope that such critical evaluation of machine learning algorithms with respect to their potential real-world effectiveness can help accelerate clinical translation and identify gaps in the current seizure detection literature.</p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15332'>Read More</a> -------- <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15332'> PDF</a><p><strong>Rating: </strong>0.0</p><p><strong>Justification: </strong>This is a systematic review of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection in EEG, which has no relevance to FSOC or the mentioned interests.</p></div></main></html>
