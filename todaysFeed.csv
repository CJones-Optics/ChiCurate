Abstract: The radial velocity catalog from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is unique in its simultaneously large volume and high precision as a result of its decade-long survey duration, multiplexing (600 fibers), and spectral resolution of $R \sim 22,500$. However, previous data reductions of APOGEE have not fully realized the potential radial velocity (RV) precision of the instrument. Here we present an RV catalog based on a new reduction of all 2.6 million visits of APOGEE DR17 and validate it against improved estimates for the theoretical RV performance. The core ideas of the new reduction are the simultaneous modeling of all components in the spectra, rather than a separate subtraction of point estimates for the sky, and a marginalization over stellar types, rather than a grid search for an optimum. We show that this catalog, when restricted to RVs measured with the same fiber, achieves noise-limited precision down to 30 m/s and delivers well-calibrated uncertainties. We also introduce a general method for calibrating fiber-to-fiber constant RV offsets and demonstrate its importance for high RV precision work in multi-fiber spectrographs. After calibration, we achieve 47 m/s RV precision on the combined catalog with RVs measured with different fibers. This degradation in precision relative to measurements with only a single fiber suggests that refining line spread function models should be a focus in SDSS-V to improve the fiber-unified RV catalog.",astro-ph.IM,"The radial velocity catalog from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is unique in its simultaneously large volume and high precision as a result of its decade-long survey duration, multiplexing (600 fibers), and spectral resolution of $R \sim 22,500$.

Abstract: Gravitational microlensing with binary lensing is one of the channels for detecting exoplanets. Due to the degeneracy of the lens parameters for the binary microlensing, additional features such as parallax and finite-size effects need to identify the lens parameters. The frequency-shift effect as the relativistic analogy of the gravity assist for the photons, is an extra observation that provides additional constraint between the lens parameters . In this work, we extend the application of the frequency shift effect to binary microlensing and derive the frequency shift during the lensing and caustic crossing. The frequency shift for the binary lens is of the order of ${\Delta\nu}/{\nu}\sim 10^{-12}$. We also investigate the feasibility of detecting this effect by employing Cross-Correlation methods .",astro-ph.EP,"Gravitational microlensing with binary lensing is one of the channels for detecting exoplanets.

Abstract: Photometric measurements allow the determination of an asteroid's absolute magnitude, which often represents the sole means to infer its size. Photometric observations can be obtained in a variety of filters that can be unique to a specific observatory. Those observations are then calibrated into specific bands with respect to reference star catalogs. In order to combine all the different measurements for evaluation, photometric observations need to be converted to a common band, typically V-band. Current band-correction schemes in use by IAU's Minor Planet Center, JPL's Center for Near Earth Object Studies and ESA's NEO Coordination Centre use average correction values for the apparent magnitude derived from photometry of asteroids as the corrections are dependent on the typically unknown spectrum of the object to be corrected. By statistically analyzing the photometric residuals of asteroids, we develop a new photometric correction scheme that does not only consider the band, but also accounts for reference catalog and observatory. We describe a new statistical photometry correction scheme for asteroid observations with debiased corrections. Testing this scheme on a reference group of asteroids, we see a 36% reduction in the photometric residuals. Moreover, the new scheme leads to a more accurate and debiased determination of the H-G magnitude system and, in turn, to more reliable inferred sizes. We discuss the significant shift in the corrections with this ""DePhOCUS"" debiasing system, its limitations, and the impact for photometric and physical properties of all asteroids, especially Near-Earth Objects.",astro-ph.EP,"Photometric measurements allow the determination of an asteroid's absolute magnitude, which often represents the sole means to infer its size.

Abstract: We present a parameter estimation algorithm on kilonova light curves using likelihood-free inference. Our inference is optimized through a pre-trained embedding network that marginalizes the time of arrival and the luminosity distance of the signal. We find that parameter inference utilizing a pre-trained embedding outperforms the use of likelihood-free inference alone, reducing training time and offering the capability to marginalize over certain nuisance parameters. The model is capable of retrieving the intrinsic parameters of the kilonova light curves with a comparable accuracy and precision to nested sampling methods while taking significantly less computational time.

Abstract: Knowing the dynamics of neuromorphic photonic schemes would allow their optimization for controlled data-processing capability at possibly minimized energy consumption levels. In nonlinear substrates such as optical fibers or semiconductors, these dynamics can widely vary depending on each optical input encoded with information to process and are in general difficult to estimate. Thus, other approaches are required to optimize the schemes. Using a frequency-multiplexed fiber-based Extreme Learning Machine as an example for a classification task, I use Shannon entropy for optical power and introduce Shannon entropy for optical phase and spectrum, all averaged only over a small subset of the dataset to process. I show that the maximum and upper moderate optical power and phase entropies relate to the best data-processing capability of the Machine and, thus, can be used to find optimal system parameters such as fiber length, input power, and group-velocity dispersion in a more time-efficient manner than running numerical simulations emulating the scheme. Shannon entropy of the spectrum provides the information for what parameter space broadest possible frequency combs can be expected and is interesting from the perspective of frequency comb and supercontinuum generation. The introduced entropies are general and can be easily applied to describe and optimize other neuromorphic-photonic or nonlinear-optics schemes.",physics.optics,"Knowing the dynamics of neuromorphic photonic schemes would allow their optimization for controlled data-processing capability at possibly minimized energy consumption levels.

Abstract: Disorder, which is ubiquitous in nature, has been extensively explored in photonics for understanding the fundamental principles of light diffusion and localization, as well as for applications in functional resonators and random lasers. Recently, the investigation of disorder in topological photonics has led to the realization of topological Anderson insulators characterized by an unexpected disorder-induced phase transition. However, the observed photonic topological Anderson insulators so far are limited to the time-reversal symmetry breaking systems. Here, we propose and realize a photonic quantum spin Hall topological Anderson insulator without breaking time-reversal symmetry. The disorder-induced topological phase transition is comprehensively confirmed through the theoretical effective Dirac Hamiltonian, numerical analysis of bulk transmission, and experimental examination of bulk and edge transmissions. We present the convincing evidence for the unidirectional propagation and robust transport of helical edge modes, which are the key features of nontrivial time-reversal invariant topological Anderson insulators. Furthermore, we demonstrate disorder-induced beam steering, highlighting the potential of disorder as a new degree of freedom to manipulate light propagation in magnetic-free systems.

Abstract: Sub-cycle optical pulse is of great importance for ultrafast science and technology. While a narrower pulse can offer a higher temporal resolution, so far the pulse width has not exceeded the limit of half an optical cycle. Here we propose to break the half-cycle limit via inverse Compton scattering in a nano-slit optical mode, in which a deep-subwavelength-confined optical field can be converted into a deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse by high-energy free electrons flying through. Our calculations show that, with experimentally reachable conditions, a measurable deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse with a width narrower than half an optical cycle can be generated. Quantitatively, using a deep-subwavelength-confined 4.4-$\mu$m-wavelength 100-fs pulsed optical driving field and a 2-MeV 50-as 5-pC electron bunch, we can obtain an attosecond pulse with a peak frequency of 2.55 PHz, a pulse width of 99 as ($\sim$0.25 optical cycle), and a single-pulse photon number larger than 200 around the material damage threshold.

Abstract: $\pi$ modes are unique topological edge states appearing in Floquet systems with periodic modulations of the underlying lattice structure in evolution variable, such as dynamically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. These edge states are anomalous states usually appearing between Floquet replicas of the same band, even if standard topological index remains zero for this band. While linear and nonlinear $\pi$ modes were observed in conservative systems, they have never been studied in nonlinear regime in the non-Hermitian systems with structured gain and losses. Here we show that SSH waveguide array with periodically oscillating waveguide positions in propagation direction and with parity-time symmetric refractive index landscape, can support $\pi$ modes that are damped or amplified at different ends of the array. By including nonlinearity and nonlinear absorption into our continuous system, we achieve stable lasing in $\pi$ mode at one end of the array. The representative feature of this system is that lasing in it is thresholdless and it occurs even at low gain-loss amplitudes. The degree of localization of lasing $\pi$ modes can be flexibly controlled by the amplitude of transverse waveguide oscillations.

Abstract: We present an all-fiber, fully open Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) cavity that is suitable for fluidic measurement applications. Fabrication of the FPI involves the alignment and bonding of three optical fiber sections using either ceramic glue or low-temperature melting glass. The fabrication procedure allows the protection of the cleaved optical fiber end faces, which serve as the two mirrors of the FPI, from damage, thus ensuring the high visibility of the FPI sensor. The FPI's complete openness permits the analyte of interest fluids to flow smoothly into the cavity and interact directly with the light, obviating the need for additional assistance. The fabrication experiment demonstrates that the fabrication procedure can readily achieve a visibility of over 20 dB. Refractive index testing indicates that the sensor exhibits a sensitivity of over 1116 nm/RIU within the range of 1.334-1.375. A comparison of temperature investigations indicates that the fully open cavity FPI fabricated by bonding with low-temperature melting glass exhibits relatively lower temperature immunity than that bonded with ceramic glue. Both have a relatively low temperature fluctuation within the temperature range of 40{\deg}C-100{\deg}C, with less than 3 nm and 4.5 nm in the over 60{\deg}C changes, respectively.

Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of photonic crystals, lacking parity-time (PT) symmetry, using scattering matrix formalism. We show using the symmetry properties of matrices that a defective photonic crystal, doped with three-level atoms, breaks PT symmetry. For the two defect modes lying in the bandgap region, both the reflection and the absorption become nonreciprocal, while the transmission remains reciprocal. We show that the relevant energy spectra do not exhibit exceptional points, thereby invalidating its necessity to achieve nonreciprocity in reflection and absorption. We further demonstrate how this nonreciprocity can be coherently controlled using the driving field and dissipation rates of the atoms.",physics.optics,"We investigate the spectral properties of photonic crystals, lacking parity-time (PT) symmetry, using scattering matrix formalism.

Abstract: Holographic light potentials generated by phase-modulating liquid-crystal spatial light modulators (SLMs) are widely used in quantum technology applications. Accurate calibration of the wavefront and intensity profile of the laser beam at the SLM display is key to the high fidelity of holographic potentials. Here, we present a new calibration technique that is faster than previous methods while maintaining the same level of accuracy. By employing stochastic optimisation and random speckle intensity patterns, we calibrate a digital twin that accurately models the experimental setup. This approach allows us to measure the wavefront at the SLM to within $\lambda /170$ in ~ 5 minutes using only 10 SLM phase patterns, a significant speedup over state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, our digital twin models pixel crosstalk on the liquid-crystal SLM, enabling rapid calibration of model parameters and reducing the error in light potentials by a factor of ~ 5 without losing efficiency. Our fast calibration technique will simplify the implementation of high-fidelity light potentials in, for example, quantum-gas microscopes and neutral-atom tweezer arrays where high-NA objectives and thermal lensing can deform the wavefront significantly.

Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit is incorrect. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n>ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit.

Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as a promising direction for information propagation with preserved coherence. Due to high tunability of magnons, their interactions with microwave photons can be engineered to probe novel phenomena based on strong photon-magnon coupling. Improving the photon-magnon coupling strength can be done by tuning the structure of microwave resonators to better interact with the magnon counterpart. Planar resonators have been explored due to their potential for on-chip integration, but only common modes from stripline-based resonators have been used.

We showcase strong magnon-LSP photon coupling using a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet sphere. We discuss the dependence of the spiral resonator design to the engineering capacity of the photon mode frequency and spatial field distributions, via both experiment and simulation. By the localized photon mode profiles, the resulting magnetic field concentrates near the surface dielectrics, giving rise to an enhanced magnetic filling factor.

Abstract: The topological response of matter to electromagnetic fields is a property in high demand in materials design and metrology due to its robustness against noise and decoherence, stimulating recent advances in ultrafast photonics. Embedding topological properties into the enantio-sensitive optical response of chiral molecules could therefore enhance the efficiency and robustness of chiral optical discrimination. Here we achieve such a topological embedding by introducing the concept of chiral topological light~-- a light beam which displays chirality locally, with an azimuthal distribution of its handedness described globally by a topological charge. The topological charge is mapped onto the azimuthal intensity modulation of the non-linear optical response, where enantio-sensitivity is encoded into its spatial rotation. The spatial rotation is robust against intensity fluctuations and imperfect local polarization states of the driving field.

Such conditions were: Administrations shall take practical measures to ensure the transmitting antennas of outdoor IMT base stations (BSs) are normally pointing below the true horizon when deployed within 10-10.5 GHz; additionally, the mechanical pointing needs to be at or below the horizon; Administrations shall use side lobe suppression techniques providing 29.5 dB of attenuation for elevation angles above 30 degrees where 0 degrees relates to the horizon and 90 degrees to the zenith, referenced to the maximum antenna gain at the boresight; The maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) emitted by an IMT base station shall not exceed 32 dB W/100 MHz.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07074

Abstract: By enabling very high bandwidth for radio communications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave), which can easily be integrated with massive-multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) due to small antenna size, has been attracting growing attention as a candidate for the fifth-generation (5G) and 5G-beyond wireless communications networks. On the other hand, the communication over the orthogonal states/modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a subset of the solutions offered by massive-MIMO communications. Traditional massive-MIMO based mmWave communications did not concern the potential spectrum-efficiency-gain (SE-gain) offered by orthogonal states of OAM. However, the highly expecting maximum SE-gain for OAM and massive-MIMO communications is the product of SE-gains offered by OAM and multiplexing-MIMO. In this paper, we propose the OAM-embedded-MIMO (OEM) communication framework to obtain the multiplicative SE-gain for joint OAM and massive-MIMO based mmWave wireless communications. We design the parabolic antenna for each uniform circular array antenna to converge OAM signals. Then, we develop the mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme to obtain the transmit signal on each OAM-mode of each transmit antenna. Also, we develop the OEM-water-filling power allocation policy to achieve the maximum multiplicative SE-gain for OEM communications. The extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate our developed parabolic antenna based converging method, mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme, and OEM-water-filling policy, showing that our proposed OEM mmWave communications can significantly increase the spectrum-efficiency as compared with traditional massive-MIMO based mmWave communications.",eess.SP,"By enabling very high bandwidth for radio communications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave), which can easily be integrated with massive-multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) due to small antenna size, has been attracting growing attention as a candidate for the fifth-generation (5G) and 5G-beyond wireless communications networks.

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has attracted much attention for radio vortex wireless communications due to the orthogonality among different OAM-modes. To maintain the orthogonality among different OAM modes at the receiver, the strict alignment between transmit and receive antennas is highly demanded. However, it is not practical to guarantee the transceiver alignment in wireless communications. The phase turbulence, resulting from the misaligned transceivers, leads to serious inter-mode interference among different OAM modes and therefore fail for signals detection of multiple OAM modes at the receiver. To achieve practical OAM based wireless communications, in this paper we investigate the radio vortex wireless communications with misaligned transmit and receive antennas. We propose a joint Beamforming and Pre-detection (BePre) scheme, which uses two unitary matrices to convert the channel matrix into the equivalent circulant matrix for keeping the orthogonality among OAM-modes at the receiver. Then, the OAM signals can be detected with the mode-decomposition scheme at the misaligned receiver. Extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate that our developed joint BePre scheme can efficiently detect the signals of multiple OAM-modes for the misaligned transceiver and can significantly increase the spectrum efficiency.",eess.SP,"Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has attracted much attention for radio vortex wireless communications due to the orthogonality among different OAM-modes.

Abstract: Localizing near-field sources considering practical arrays is a recent challenging topic for next generation wireless communication systems. Practical antenna array apertures with closely spaced elements exhibit direction-dependent mutual coupling (MC), which can significantly degrade the performance localization techniques. A conventional method for near-field localization in the presence of MC is the three-dimensional (3D) multiple signal classification technique, which, however, suffers from extremely high computational complexity. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) search alternatives have been presented, exhibiting increased complexity still for direction-dependent MC scenarios. In this paper, we devise a low complexity one-dimensional (1D) iterative method based on an oblique projection operator (IMOP) that estimates direction-dependent MC and the locations of multiple near-field sources. The proposed method first estimates the initial direction of arrival (DOA) and MC using the approximate wavefront model, and then, estimates the initial range of one near-field source using the exact wavefront model. Afterwards, at each iteration, the oblique projection operator is used to isolate components associated with one source from those of other sources. The DOA and range of this one source are estimated using the exact wavefront model and 1D searches. Finally, the direction-dependent MC is estimated for each pair of the estimated DOA and range. The performance of the proposed near-field localization approach is comprehensively investigated and verified using both a full-wave electromagnetic solver and synthetic simulations. It is showcased that our IMOP scheme performs almost similarly to a state-of-the-art approach but with a 42 times less computational complexity.",eess.SP,"Localizing near-field sources considering practical arrays is a recent challenging topic for next generation wireless communication systems.

Abstract: While the widely available embedded sensors in smartphones and other wearable devices make it easier to obtain data of human activities, recognizing different types of human activities from sensor-based data remains a difficult research topic in ubiquitous computing. One reason for this is that most of the collected data is unlabeled. However, many current human activity recognition (HAR) systems are based on supervised methods, which heavily rely on the labels of the data. We describe a weakly self-supervised approach in this paper that consists of two stages: (1) In stage one, the model learns from the nature of human activities by projecting the data into an embedding space where similar activities are grouped together; (2) In stage two, the model is fine-tuned using similarity information in a few-shot learning fashion using the similarity information of the data. This allows downstream classification or clustering tasks to benefit from the embeddings. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and show that our approach can help the clustering algorithm achieve comparable performance in identifying and categorizing the underlying human activities as pure supervised techniques applied directly to a corresponding fully labeled data set.",eess.SP,"While the widely available embedded sensors in smartphones and other wearable devices make it easier to obtain data of human activities, recognizing different types of human activities from sensor-based data remains a difficult research topic in ubiquitous computing.

Abstract: Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) systems incur substantial resource consumption due to the management of backhaul links and the coordination among various base stations (BSs). Accurate prediction of coordinated spectral efficiency (CSE) can guide the optimization of network parameters, resulting in enhanced resource utilization efficiency. However, characterizing the CSE is intractable due to the inherent complexity of the CoMP channel model and the diversity of the 5G dynamic network environment, which poses a great challenge for CSE prediction in real-world 5G CoMP systems. To address this challenge, in this letter, we propose a data-driven model-assisted approach. Initially, we leverage domain knowledge to preprocess the collected raw data, thereby creating a well-informed dataset. Within this dataset, we explicitly define the target variable and the input feature space relevant to channel statistics for CSE prediction. Subsequently, a residual-based network model is built to capture the high-dimensional non-linear mapping function from the channel statistics to the CSE.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has emerged as a pivotal task for reliable device authentication.

These challenges diminish the capability of RFFI methods in feature representation, complicating the effective identification of device identities.

The MPDFormer employs a spectrum offset-based periodic embedding representation to augment the discrepency of intrinsic features. We delve into the intricacies of the periodicity-dependency attention mechanism, integrating both inter-period and intra-period attention mechanisms. This mechanism facilitates the extraction of both long and short-range periodicity-dependency features , accentuating the feature distinction whilst concurrently attenuating the perturbations caused by background noise and weak-periodicity features.

Abstract: A biofilm is a microbial city. It consists of bacteria embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that functions as a protective barrier. Quorum sensing (QS) is a method of bacterial communication, where autoinducers (AIs) propagate via diffusion through the EPS and water channels within the biofilm. This diffusion process is anisotropic due to varying densities between the EPS and water channels. This study introduces a 2D anisotropic diffusion model for molecular communication (MC) within biofilms, analyzing information propagation between a point-to-point transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) in bounded space. The channel impulse response is derived using Green's function for concentration (GFC) and is validated with particle-based simulation (PBS). The outcomes reveal similar results for both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion when the TX is centrally located due to symmetry. However, anisotropic conditions lead to greater diffusion peaks when the TX is positioned off-center. Additionally, the propagation of AIs is inversely proportional to both overall biofilm size and and diffusion coefficient values.

This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets.

Abstract: Continuous phase modulation (CPM) has extensive applications in wireless communications due to its high spectral and power efficiency. However, its nonlinear characteristics pose significant challenges for detection in frequency selective fading channels. This paper proposes an iterative receiver tailored for the detection of CPM signals over frequency selective fading channels. This design leverages the factor graph framework to integrate equalization, demodulation, and decoding functions. The equalizer employs the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm, while the unitary transformation is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the aid of a cyclic prefix (CP), thereby achieving low computational complexity while with high performance. For CPM demodulation and channel decoding, with belief propagation (BP), we design a message passing-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, and the message exchange between the demodulator, decoder and equalizer is elaborated. With proper message passing schedules, the receiver can achieve fast convergence. Simulation results show that compared with existing turbo receivers, the proposed receiver delivers significant performance enhancement with low computational complexity.",cs.IT,"Continuous phase modulation (CPM) has extensive applications in wireless communications due to its high spectral and power efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, universal waveform generation tasks have been investigated conditioned on various out-of-distribution scenarios. Although GAN-based methods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they are vulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stage text-to-speech. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerful generative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of the limelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. Above all, there is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the natural periodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. In this paper, we propose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. First, we introduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodic features of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields. Additionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps to capture different periodic features of waveform signals. Although increasing the number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requires more computational costs. To reduce this issue, we also propose a single period-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel by period-wise batch inference. Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelet transform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveform signals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce the high-frequency noise for waveform generation. The experimental results demonstrated that our model outperforms the previous models both in Mel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks.

Abstract: Undersampling can accelerate the signal acquisition but at the cost of bringing in artifacts.

Through modeling signals as the superimposed exponential functions, deep learning has achieved fast and high-fidelity signal reconstruction by training a mapping from the undersampled exponentials to the fully sampled ones. However, the mismatch, such as the sampling rate of undersampling, the organ and the contrast of imaging, between the training and target data will heavily compromise the reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose Alternating Deep Low-Rank (ADLR), which combines deep learning solvers and classic optimization solvers.

Current deep neural network (NN)-based CS methods face the challenges of collecting labeled measurement-ground truth (GT) data and generalizing to real applications. This paper proposes a novel $\mathbf{S}$elf-supervised s$\mathbf{C}$alable deep CS method, comprising a deep $\mathbf{L}$earning scheme called $\mathbf{SCL}$ and a family of $\mathbf{Net}$works named $\mathbf{SCNet}$, which does not require GT and can handle arbitrary sampling ratios and matrices once trained on a partial measurement set. Our SCL contains a dual-domain loss and a four-stage recovery strategy. The former encourages a cross-consistency on two measurement parts and a sampling-reconstruction cycle-consistency regarding arbitrary ratios and matrices to maximize data/information utilization. The latter can progressively leverage common signal prior in external measurements and internal characteristics of test samples and learned NNs to improve accuracy. SCNet combines both the explicit guidance from optimization algorithms with implicit regularization from advanced NN blocks to learn a collaborative signal representation. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 1-/2-/3-D natural and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, superior performance, flexibility, and generalization ability of our method over existing self-supervised methods and its significant potential in competing against state-of-the-art supervised methods.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) facilitates the extraction of unpredictable channel features for physical layer key generation (PKG), securing communications among legitimate users with symmetric keys. Previous works have demonstrated that channel reciprocity plays a crucial role in generating symmetric keys in PKG systems, whereas, in reality, reciprocity is greatly affected by hardware interference and RIS-based jamming attacks. This motivates us to propose LoCKey, a novel approach that aims to improve channel reciprocity by mitigating interferences and attacks with a loop-back compensation scheme, thus maximizing the secrecy performance of the PKG system. Specifically, our proposed LoCKey is capable of effectively compensating for the CSI non-reciprocity by the combination of transmit-back signal value and error minimization module. Firstly, we introduce the entire flowchart of our method and provide an in-depth discussion of each step. Following that, we delve into a theoretical analysis of the performance optimizations when our LoCKey is applied for CSI reciprocity enhancement. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LoCKey in improving channel reciprocity under various interferences for RIS-assisted wireless communications.

The first approach addresses scenarios where signal sharing is not feasible due to privacy concerns or fronthaul limitations. Our findings reveal that maintaining comparable accuracy is remarkably achievable, yet it comes with an increase in computational demand. The second approach considers a central model and multiple distributed models collaboratively classifying the modulation. This hybrid model leverages diversity gain through signal combining and requires synchronization and signal sharing.
